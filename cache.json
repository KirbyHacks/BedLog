Introducing Realms Saves, a new and improved version of our previous backup system. Keep your Realms worlds safe with a new bank of cloud storage included with your Realms subscription. Realms saves come in two flavors: Automatic saves are functionally the same as our previous \"backups\" system: They are on by default - no need to enable anything to keep your Realm world safe with automatic saves. They are taken at the end of every Realms play session when the server shuts down, or every 30 minutes during a play session. They are only retained for a limited time, according to our retention policy (which has not changed with this update): How Mojang Saves Backups for Your Minecraft Realm | Minecraft Help They do not count towards your bank of cloud storage. All previous Realms backups will be converted to automatic saves. Manual saves are created by the Realm owner and count towards a bank of storage that comes with your Realms subscription. Manual saves are retained as long as your Realm is. They are not automatically deleted by our retention policy*, but Realm owners can delete manual saves if they want to free up storage space. Realms Plus subscriptions come with 10GB of manual save storage and Realms core subscriptions come with 5GB. Automatic saves can be turned into manual saves by the Realm owner. Realms saves can be found in the Realms settings menu accessed via the \"Edit Realm\" button rather than the Realms world settings menu that backups used to show up in. While playing on the Realm, saves can also be found in the in-game settings menu for the Realm owner. Realms saves will also now list the world name and the packs that were applied at the time of the save.\n169.

Added component minecraft:support behind the Upcoming Creator Features toggle Example:\n579. Created a new block trait, minecraft:connection, to expose behavior like Fences or Glass Panes from Vanilla where blocks connect to other blocks around them. Using this trait with the example below adds the bool states minecraft:connection_north, minecraft:connection_east, minecraft:connection_south, and minecraft:connection_west. This is only available while the \"Upcoming Creator Features\" toggle is enabled Example:\n580. One known issue with this is that blocks using minecraft:connection don't properly decide connections to blocks like Fences, Walls, Iron Bars, Fence Gates, and Glass Panes. Addressing this issue is currently in development\n581. Added component minecraft:connection_rule behind the Upcoming Creator Features toggle which allows custom blocks to define whether other blocks with connection behavior - such as fences, walls, bars, and glass panes - can try to create a connection.\n582. Added VanillaBlockTag minecraft:has_fence_connections that can be used to identify a custom block as a block that creates connections like a fence; this tag is required to create connections between custom and Vanilla fences. The component and tag can be used along with the minecraft:connection block trait to make a custom fence that creates connections like a Vanilla fence. The following is an example of how they fit into the JSON of a custom fence block:\n583. Added new state minecraft:corner_and_cardinal_direction to the minecraft:placement_direction block trait which enables the minecraft:corner with values none, inner_left, inner_right, outer_left, and outer_right to provide similar behavior to how stairs in Vanilla work When this is set, you can use the field blocks_to_corner_with to decide the criteria with an array of block descriptors to determine what blocks to form a corner with The default behavior for this field is to corner with the same block name This all requires the Beta APIs toggle to be enabled on a world and the use_beta_features flag on your block\n584. When this is set, you can use the field blocks_to_corner_with to decide the criteria with an array of block descriptors to determine what blocks to form a corner with\n585. The default behavior for this field is to corner with the same block name\n586. This all requires the Beta APIs toggle to be enabled on a world and the use_beta_features flag on your block\n587. With the Beta APIs toggle on, Vanilla Stairs have the tag minecraft:cornerable_stairs available, and can corner with custom blocks with the same tag if the block also uses minecraft:cardinal_direction block states\n588. Blocks using minecraft:placement_direction Block Trait with the minecraft:corner_and_cardinal_direction had the inner_left/outer_left and inner_right/outer_right states backwards when a block was facing south or west\n589. Made blocks that use the minecraft:placement_position block trait with the state minecraft:vertical_half and minecraft:placement_direction with the state minecraft:corner_and_cardinal_direction update the corner state immediately instead of happening a tick later\n590. We now will mirror the minecraft:corner block state when used within a structure\n591. Added minecraft:redstone_consumer component behind the Upcoming Creator Features experiment. A component describing how a block can consume and potentially propogate a redstone signal Contains optional field min_power which defines the minimum value for incoming signal stregth. If signal strength is greater than or equal to this value then the onRedstoneUpdate event is sent to Scripts. Defaults to 0 meaning event is always emitted Contains optional field propogates_power a Boolean to control whether a signal can pass through this block or not, defaults to false This component is currently not available for block permutations Example: {\n    \"format_version\": \"1.21.130\",\n    \"minecraft:block\": {\n        \"description\": {\n            \"identifier\": \"test:custom_consumer_block\"\n        },\n        \"components\": {\n            \"minecraft:redstone_consumer\": {\n                \"min_power\": 5,\n                \"propogates_power\": true\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n592. Contains optional field min_power which defines the minimum value for incoming signal stregth. If signal strength is greater than or equal to this value then the onRedstoneUpdate event is sent to Scripts. Defaults to 0 meaning event is always emitted\n593. Contains optional field propogates_power a Boolean to control whether a signal can pass through this block or not, defaults to false\n594. This component is currently not available for block permutations\n595. Example: {\n    \"format_version\": \"1.21.130\",\n    \"minecraft:block\": {\n        \"description\": {\n            \"identifier\": \"test:custom_consumer_block\"\n        },\n        \"components\": {\n            \"minecraft:redstone_consumer\": {\n                \"min_power\": 5,\n                \"propogates_power\": true\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n596. Modified minecraft:material_instances block component Removed redundant experimental field shaded formerly named emissive Same effect can be achieved with existing fields, example below\n597. Removed redundant experimental field shaded formerly named emissive\n598. Same effect can be achieved with existing fields, example below\n599. Added minecraft:leashable block component, which allows custom blocks to receive a lead attachment, including an offset field to change the position of the leash knot. Currently only available with \"Upcoming Creator Features\" enabled\n600. Initial experimental support for \"Prefabs\" in the Editor This feature is highly experimental, has some issues, is guaranteed to change and is not yet documented Do not use in production projects\n601. This feature is highly experimental, has some issues, is guaranteed to change and is not yet documented\n602. Do not use in production projects\n603. Added a \"Prefab Template Manager\" to help create, edit and delete prefab templates\n604. Added a \"Prefab Instance Editor\" to allow placement of prefabs in the scene, and edit the properties of the instance\n605.

Armor toughness: 4\n11. Copper Golem will drop between 1 and 3 Copper Ingots when killed\n12. Copper Golem can help with sorting items into Chests\n13. If the Copper Golem has fully oxidized it will turn into a Copper Golem Statue Block\n14. When turned into a Copper Golem Statue block, it will freeze in a random pose\n15. When turned into a Copper Golem Statue the Copper Golem will drop any item it may be holding\n16. A Copper Golem turned into a Copper Golem Statue will keep its name if named with a Name Tag\n17. Interacting with the Copper Golem with an empty hand will drop its carried item\n18. Iron Golems will sometimes plant a decorative flower onto a nearby Copper Golem\n19. If the Copper Golem is not holding an item, it will look for nearby Copper Chests to try to pick up an item\n20. The Copper Golem will look in any oxidized and waxed Copper Chest variant to pick up items\n21. It can pick up max 16 items in a stack at a time\n22. Any item in a Copper Chest can be picked up\n23. If the Copper Golem is holding an item, it will look for nearby Chests to try to place the item in\n24. The Copper Golem will look in Chests and Trapped Chests to try to place items\n25. It can place an item in a Chest if it's empty, or if it contains the same type of item it is holding in its hand\n26. The Copper Golem will visit max 10 Chests or Copper Chests in sequence to try to pick up or place an item\n27. If no matching chest is found the Copper Golem will idle for 7 seconds before trying again\n28. The search area for chests from the Copper Golem's position is horizontally 32 blocks and vertically 8 blocks\n29. Copper Golem Statue Block is a new type of decorative block which has waxed and oxidized variants\n30. Copper Golem Statue Block oxidizes over time and can be waxed like Copper blocks\n31. The pose of the block can be changed by interacting with it\n32. If the Copper Golem Statue Block has no oxidation when interacted with using an Axe, the block will turn into a Copper Golem again\n33. When connected to a Redstone Comparator, the Copper Golem Statue Block emits a Redstone signal based on its current pose\n34.

The Shelf can be crafted from six matching blocks of any Stripped Log, Stripped Stem, or Block of Stripped Bamboo, filling the top and bottom row This recipe produces 6 Shelves\n61. This recipe produces 6 Shelves\n62. The Shelf can store up to 3 item stacks: Interacting with any of the 3 slots on its front swaps the player's main hand item with the content of that slot The Shelf displays all items it contains in front of it, similar to an Item Frame\n63. Interacting with any of the 3 slots on its front swaps the player's main hand item with the content of that slot\n64. The Shelf displays all items it contains in front of it, similar to an Item Frame\n65. While a Shelf is powered by Redstone, its front texture changes to reflect that it's powered; when placed next to each other, up to 3 powered Shelves will connect Interacting with a single powered Shelf swaps all its contents with the 3 rightmost items in the player's hotbar Interacting with two connected Shelves swaps their contents with the 6 rightmost items in the player's hotbar Interacting with three connected Shelves swaps their contents with all items in the player's hotbar It does not matter which of the connected Shelves the player interacts with\n66. Interacting with a single powered Shelf swaps all its contents with the 3 rightmost items in the player's hotbar\n67.

Interacting with three connected Shelves swaps their contents with all items in the player's hotbar\n69. It does not matter which of the connected Shelves the player interacts with\n70. Shelf storage affects a Comparator's output signal depending on which slots are occupied ( MCPE-225226 ) Each Shelf slot corresponds to 1 bit The signal strength is determined by converting the 3 bits of the slots into a decimal value All slots empty [000] means a signal strength of 0 Only the first slot occupied [100] means a signal strength of 1 Only the second slot occupied [010] means a signal strength of 2 Only the third slot occupied [001] means a signal strength of 4 All slots occupied [111] means a signal strength of 7\n71. Each Shelf slot corresponds to 1 bit\n72. The signal strength is determined by converting the 3 bits of the slots into a decimal value\n73. All slots empty [000] means a signal strength of 0\n74. Only the first slot occupied [100] means a signal strength of 1\n75. Only the second slot occupied [010] means a signal strength of 2\n76. Only the third slot occupied [001] means a signal strength of 4\n77. All slots occupied [111] means a signal strength of 7\n78. Dye Colors now have updated icons The goal with these is to enhance visual cohesion across the dye set while maintaining distinct shapes to support colorblind accessibility\n79. The goal with these is to enhance visual cohesion across the dye set while maintaining distinct shapes to support colorblind accessibility\n80. Text to Speech support has been added to all Dressing Room pages\n81.

Camera custom FOV command no longer requires the Experimental Creator Cameras experimental toggle\n298. Models exported via Structure Blocks no longer use the missing texture for all block geometry ( MCPE-223559 )\n299. Changed defaults for color grading contrast and saturation fields to 1. Previously the defaults were 1.2 and 1.05, respectively\n300. Setting the \"minecraft:use_modifiers\" component's \"movement_modifier\" field to 1.0 now allows using the item while sprinting, and starting to sprint while using the item\n301. \"poly_mesh\" is no longer treated or documented as an experimental feature\n302. \"texture_meshes\" is no longer treated or documented as an experimental feature\n303. The \"scale\" field can now adjust the depth of \"texture_meshes\", since its value is no longer ignored\n304. Added the \"use_pixel_depth\" option to \"texture_meshes\" to control how geometry depth relates to texture resolution If set to \"true\", the geometry will have a depth of one pixel (in entity space, not texture space) This causes textures with a resolution different from 16x16 to appear stretched If set to \"false\", the geometry will be built from perfectly cubic voxels, regardless of the texture's aspect ratio Defaults to \"true\" to ensure backward compatibility\n305. If set to \"true\", the geometry will have a depth of one pixel (in entity space, not texture space) This causes textures with a resolution different from 16x16 to appear stretched\n306. This causes textures with a resolution different from 16x16 to appear stretched\n307. If set to \"false\", the geometry will be built from perfectly cubic voxels, regardless of the texture's aspect ratio\n308. Defaults to \"true\" to ensure backward compatibility\n309. Added Armor and Armor Toughness values to Armor tooltips ( MCPE-152962 )\n310. \"poly_mesh\" is now documented as a deprecated feature It was already treated as deprecated, but the documentation did not reflect this\n311.

The minecraft:shareables component now also accepts item entries specifying item tags to name all items tagged as that to become shareable with the given settings\n319. Foxes now use the minecraft:is_food tag instead of listing all foods manually, except glow_berries which is still listed manually\n320. Fixed a bug where the minecraft:shareables component would mix attributes of duplicated entries in its items list. E.g. the priority would be taken from the first duplicated element and the max_amount from the last. Now the first \"matching\" entry will fully shadow those coming after it. Consider this items list in a minecraft:shareables using the new tag functionality: \"items\": [  \n  { \"item\": \"minecraft:apple\", \"priority\": 1, \"max_amount\": 2 },\n  { \"item\": \"minecraft:is_food\", \"priority\": 0, \"max_amount\": 1 }]\n321. Previously minecraft:apple would have had priority 1 but max_amount 1 instead of 2. Now it will correctly use all data from that first item apple entry.\n322. Renamed query.is_cooldown_type to query.is_cooldown_category, to better reflect what it does\n323. Modified the binary format of PlayerArmorDamagePacket\n324.

Expanded LootTableManager beta functionality, which now allows for loot table discovery via the new getLootTable method\n344. Added enum HeldItemOption to beta for PlayerSwingEventOptions. This specifies options related to the item currently being held at the time of a player swing export enum HeldItemOption {  \n    AnyItem = 'AnyItem',       \n    NoItem = 'NoItem'  \n}\n345. Added interface PlayerSwingEventOptions to beta. Event options/filters for PlayerSwingStartAfterEvent. - Field heldItemOption?: HeldItemOption Added class PlayerSwingStartAfterEvent to beta. This contains information regarding a player starting to swing their arm Field heldItemStack?: ItemStack Field player: Player Added class PlayerSwingStartAfterEventSignal to beta.

Added the minecraft:behavior.transport_items AI goal, allows a mob to transport items from and to containers Description: If the mob is not carrying an item it will try to find a container matching source_container_types and will attempt to take an item from the first non-empty slot. It will take the largest of max_stack_size and the size of the stack in that slot. If the container is empty or it does not find a match it will remember this container as visited and search for the next container from which to pick up an item. If it fails to find an unvisited container from which to pick up items it will disable the goal for idle_cooldown seconds and reset what containers it has visited. Once it has picked up an item it resets what containers it has visited. If the mob is carrying an item it will try to find a container matching destination_container_types and attempt to put its carried item in it. It will put as much of the carried item as possible into the container. If it is still carrying an item (the container is full) it will remember the container as visited and try to find the next container to put items in. If it fails to find an unvisited container in which to put items it will disable the goal for idle_cooldown seconds and reset what containers it has visited. Once it has stored items and is empty handed again it resets what containers it has visited. If at any point the target container becomes an invalid target (the block could be removed or a chest could have a cat sit on it for example), the mob will mark the position as visited and move to the next target.

Default is empty (no items disallowed)\n150. source_container_types: A list of block descriptors that should be a container type to get items from. Default is any container\n151. destination_container_types: A list of block descriptors that should be a container type to put items in. Default is any container\n152. max_stack_size: The maximum stack size that the mob will try to take from a container. Default is 16\n153. interaction_time: The amount of time spent interacting with the containers in seconds. Default is 3.0\n154. allow_simultaneous_interaction: Whether the entity is allowed to simultaneously interact with a container that another non-player entity is already interacting with. Default is false\n155. search_strategy: Whether to select the nearest valid container or a random valid container in range. valid values are \"nearest\" or \"random\" (default).\n156. search_distance: The maximum horizontal and vertical distance at which to find containers for taking or placing items. Default [62, 32]\n157. max_visited_containers: The maximum number of containers the mob will visit before resetting. 0 is unlimited and default is 16\n158. initial_cooldown: Time, in seconds, the mob will wait after spawning or after its available goals have changed (e.g. due to a component group update). Default is 0\n159. idle_cooldown: When the mob cannot find a valid container to interact with, the goal will be disabled for this amount of time in seconds. Default is 20\n160. place_strategy: governs which container contents the goal is allowed to add to: \"with_matching\": Only allows placing item in a container already having stack(s) of item. \"with_matching_or_empty\": Like the above, but additionally allows placement in empty containers. \"any\": Puts no restriction, allows placement of item in container as long as there is space. This is the default behavior.\n161. \"with_matching\": Only allows placing item in a container already having stack(s) of item.\n162. \"with_matching_or_empty\": Like the above, but additionally allows placement in empty containers.\n163. \"any\": Puts no restriction, allows placement of item in container as long as there is space.

At the moment Chests, Copper Chests, Barrels, and Shulker Boxes are the only supported containers\n170. Custom biome names are no longer implied by their filenames. Biome names are explicitly specified via the \"identifier\" property under the \"description\" sub-object of their JSON definition.\n171. Biome identifiers must now be namespaced (ex: \"minecraft:plains\"). Client biomes with a format version lower than 1.21.90 will have their identifier automatically prefixed \"minecraft:\" when loaded if no namespace is already specified.\n172. Updates biome documentation to match updated biome JSON formatting and requirements.\n173. Biomes client settings now look up settings based on the biome's full name, including its namespace. Vanilla biomes will fall back on their name without a namespace if an exact match is not found before falling back on default settings (for example, \"minecraft:plains\" will match itself, then \"plains\" if no setting was found)\n174.

The message parameter of the setText method on BlockSignComponent no longer accepts a RawText as an option. This option was redundant as it is covered by the existing RawMessage option. This affects the setText method in all versions. .\n179. Updated many error strings to use consistent punctuation.\n180. The properties minValue and maxValue on the ArgumentOutOfBoundsError class are now optional. .\n181. Updated several APIs to throw ArgumentOutOfBoundsError instead of Error where appropriate. . This affects the following APIs in all versions: Entity.addEffect for when the amplifier setting is out of bounds (0 - 255) or duration setting is out of bounds (1 - 20000000).

An example is calling the Entity method remove on a player\n200. Added new error class EntitySpawnError which is thrown when an entity fails to spawn via the spawnEntity method on Dimension\n201. Updated many methods to throw custom errors to provide better context and information of the problem that occurred\n202. Fixed a bug where \"ambient\" sounds played by a flying mob would have the volume set to 0.2 by default ( MCPE-298575 )\n203. Updated \"minecraft:grass_appearance\" component with \"grass_is_shaded\" variable if true it adds a shading effect to the grass as if there was a roof.\n204. \"alpha_test_to_opaque\", \"alpha_test_single_sided_to_opaque\", and \"blend_to_opaque\" will now shift to \"opaque\" in the distance again when used as render method in minecraft:material_instances\n205. Removed Upcoming Creator Features toggle requirement from Movable Component.\n206. Released the component minecraft:random_offset from experimental for block format versions 1.21.100 or higher\n207. Fix incorrect destruction particles on blocks that do not have a \"minecraft:destruction_particles\" component on the base block json definition, it will now fall back to the \"minecraft:material_instances\" component's definition for that permutation like it used to\n208. Fixed a crash related to reading incorrect or corrupt json data for animated blocks. Instead we now trigger a content error and prevent the block from animating.\n209. Blocks with improperly configured textures will now show additional content errors\n210. Released the particle count field for the block destruction particles component out of experimental\n211. Modified minecraft:geometry block component Field uv_lock no longer requires Upcoming Creator Features experiment to work. JSON format_version still needs to be >= 1.21.90\n212.

Caustics textures with incorrect dimensions will no longer be loaded; a content error will be issued and the default caustics texture will be used instead\n249. Fixed parent_setup not running with the correct context\n250. Fixed an issue where custom armor disabled knockback on some platforms\n251. Added minecraft:blockstate_match and minecraft:random_blockstate_match rules to jigsaw processors.\n252. Added heightmap projection type none and made it the default setting, which instead of performing heightmap calculations uses the starting placement position.\n253. query.is_carrying_block is now usable by all entities, not just Enderman\n254. query.is_carrying_block returns 1.0 if the entity is carrying any block, including air\n255. Modified Json parsing of \"variations\" texture objects in terrain_texture.json files weight field clamped to minimum value of 0.05 weight field clamped to maximum value of 1000000\n256. weight field clamped to minimum value of 0.05\n257. weight field clamped to maximum value of 1000000\n258. Fixed a bug where the death screen could be shown while the player was alive when certain gamepad buttons where pressed at the same time\n259. Added preview sounds for the new audio tab\n260. Endermen can now pick up all block types they are able to in Java Edition\n261.

This can be used to modify the FOV of the current camera Added class LootTableManager to beta, which allows for generation of loot from entities and blocks\n291. Added class LootTableManager to beta, which allows for generation of loot from entities and blocks\n292. Added easing options for clearing a custom FOV. Clearing without valid easing values will instantly clear the custom FOV value\n293. Adding a new server side biome component surface_builder that will combine the components surface_parameters, frozen_ocean_surface, mesa_surface, swamp_surface, capped_surface, and the_end_surface into one component. Each biome can only use one builder type. The component can be used for world generation settings such as foundation material and sea floor depth.\n294. Added \"minecraft:humidity\" component with \"is_humid\" this forces a biome to either always be humid or never humid. Humidity effects the spread chance, and spread rate of fire in the biome.\n295. Added 'minecraft:partially_frozen' This component will impact the temperature in a frozen biome, causing some areas to not be frozen. Ex: patchy ice, patchy snow.\n296. Added the fov_set keyword to the /camera command for changing the camera's field of view. Enabled with the Experimental Creator Camera toggle\n297. 'locate structure' command (and similar structure-searching gameplay elements) will now quickly return no result if experimental Custom Biomes have replaced all of the biomes where that structure could appear\n298. When loading a chunk that used a removed custom biome, the removed biome is now replaced with the dimension's default biome, which is Ocean in the overworld\n299. max_distance_from_center now parses horizontal and vertical values separately in an object while supporting horizontal only with parsing as a constant, the vertical value is now optional and defaults to having no limit.\n300.

When waterlogged it undergoes 3 states over about 20 minutes until it spawns a Ghastling mob\n4. Makes sounds and shows particles depending on state\n5. If mined during the waterlogging, it will revert to its \u201cdry\u201d state regardless of what state it has reached during waterlogging\n6. Will revert states back to its initial \u201cdry\u201d state when it is taken away from being waterlogged, using the same time scale\n7. Piglins can give Dried Ghast Blocks when bartered with\n8. Added new achievement \"Stay Hydrated!\"\n9. Spawns from a Dried Ghast block that has continuously been waterlogged for about 20 minutes\n10. After spawning, the Ghastling will try and follow: Players within a 16-block radius or An adult, non-aquatic passive mob (and some neutral mobs) within a 16-block radius\n11. Players within a 16-block radius or\n12. An adult, non-aquatic passive mob (and some neutral mobs) within a 16-block radius\n13. If no player or suitable mob is close around the Ghastling will idle around within 32 blocks from its home position (where it spawned or was last interacted with)\n14. Can be tempted and fed using Snowballs\n15. Will grow up into a Happy Ghast after about 20 minutes (or faster if fed Snowballs)\n16. Can be summoned using the command: /summon happy_ghast ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ minecraft:spawn_baby\n17. Spawns from a Ghastling after about 20 minutes (or faster if Ghastling is fed Snowballs)\n18. Can be equipped with a harness and then be mounted by up to 4 players\n19. Tempted by Snowballs and Harness. Harness tempting only works if the Happy Ghast is unharnessed\n20. Has no panic behavior when taking damage\n21. Cannot be bred\n22. Slowly regenerates health, with regeneration speeding up during rain, snow or when flying at the same height as clouds are rendered\n23. The first player that mounts the Happy Ghast will control it, sitting in front of the Happy Ghast, just above its face\n24. When a player mounts, the goggles on the Happy Ghast go down to cover its eyes, indicating that it can now be controlled\n25. Other players who mount after the pilot is mounted, are placed in slots on each side of the Happy Ghast, starting clockwise from the \u201cpilot\u201d player\n26. Pressing crouch button dismounts the player on top of the Happy Ghast\n27. If the Happy Ghast detects players on top of it, it then ceases all movement and aligns to the closest cardinal horizontal direction\n28. This happens regardless of it having a harness equipped or not\n29. 3rd person camera is moved back when player is mounted on the Happy Ghast\n30. When there are no players mounted or walking on the Happy Ghast, the goggles go up and the Happy Ghast starts to roam around the home position\n31. If players dismount midair, the Happy Ghast will descend towards the ground before it resumes roaming\n32. Cannot enter Boats\n33. Idles around within 64 blocks from its home position (where it spawned or last was interacted with)\n34. If wearing a harness, the Happy Ghast idles closer to the home position (within 32 blocks)\n35. The Happy Ghast will try to stay close to blocks when roaming on its own\n36. Crafted out of 3 Leather, 2 Glass Blocks and 1 Wool Block, the Harness will have the same color as the Wool Block used when crafting\n37. Can be re-dyed\n38. Can only be equipped on a Happy Ghast\n39. Allows up to 4 players to mount the Happy Ghast\n40. Can be removed from the Happy Ghast using Shears but only when no players are mounted\n41. The Locator Bar is a new UI element on the Player HUD that displays the direction of other Players in the World\n42. When there are multiple Players in a World, the Locator Bar will appear on-screen for each Player, replacing the Experience Bar. The Player Level number will still be visible as before above the Locator Bar\n43. The Locator Bar will display colored indicators when the camera is facing within 120 degrees towards another Player. If another Player is 30 degrees above or below the camera's viewport (the screen) an up or down arrow will be displayed\n44. Crouching will hide the Player, preventing their indicator from appearing on the Locator Bar of other Players\n45. Players in Spectator Mode are not visible on the Locator Bar\n46. A Mob Head or a Carved Pumpkin will similarly hide Players from the Locator Bar when worn in the head slot.\n47. Using a Potion of Invisibility will also hide players from the Locator Bar\n48. We are making Saddles craftable and generally making it easier to remove them from mobs by using Shears. We have also added Leather to some loot tables instead of Saddles\n49.

Example: Attempting to shear a leashed Sheep will now un-leash it instead of shearing it\n58. Leash break distance is now calculated between the centers of the two entities' collision boxes, aligning with the rest of the leash physics calculations\n59. Using a Firework Rocket to boost while flying with an Elytra now causes leashed mobs to unleash\n60. Entities can now be leashed to a pre-existing Leash Knot by interacting with it\n61.

The distance at which leashes break has been increased to 12 blocks, except for the Happy Ghast, which has a leash break distance of 16 blocks\n75. When dragged on the leash, leashed objects will now orient themselves towards the leasher\n76. The distance between centers of entities bounding boxes, rather than their feet is used to determine the distance between two leashed entities\n77. Boats and large leashable mobs that cannot fit in a Boat (Horses, Donkeys, Mules, Camels, and Sniffers) when leashed to a Happy Ghast are rendered with four leashes instead of one\n78. In this configuration, the harnessed Happy Ghast also features a custom rope layer wrapping around it\n79. Shears can now be used on leashed entities to unleash them, removing both incoming and outgoing leash connections\n80. Shears can now be used to remove Leash Knots\n81. Players cannot cut other players' leashes\n82. Dispensers can now use shears to unleash leashed entities\n83. Saddles, Horse Armor, Harnesses, and Carpets can now be removed from the mobs they can be equipped on by using Shears\n84. Saddles, Horse Armor, Harnesses, and Carpets cannot be removed by using Shears while the mob has a rider\n85. Saddles, Horse Armor, Harnesses, and Carpets cannot be removed by using Shears while the player is sneaking\n86. Saddles cannot be removed from Ravagers using Shears\n87. Dispensers with Shears cannot remove Saddles, Horse Armor, Harnesses, or Carpets equipped on mobs\n88. Removing Saddles, Horse Armor, Harnesses, and Carpets using Shears now plays custom sounds\n89.

Shears now consume durability when used on Beehives and Bee Nests with full Honey level ( MCPE-63995 )\n92. Shields now take durability damage from explosions ( MCPE-121484 )\n93. The maximum amount of Raw Rabbits dropped from Rabbits is now increased by 1 for each level of Looting ( MCPE-47125 )\n94. Iron Axe with Efficiency I now always generates in a Chest inside Woodland Mansion's tree-chopping room ( MCPE-109048 )\n95. Enable the \"Drop 2 2025\" experimental toggle to test out these new features!\n96. Can be found in the Nether in Nether Fossil structures\n97. Can be crafted with 1 Bone block and 8 Ghast Tears\n98. When waterlogged it undergoes 3 states over about 20 minutes until it spawns a Ghastling mob\n99. Makes sounds and shows particles depending on state\n100. If mined during the waterlogging, it will revert to its \"dry\" state regardless of what state it has reached during waterlogging\n101. Will revert states back to its initial \"dry\" state when it is taken away from being waterlogged, using the same time scale\n102. Spawns from a Dried Ghast block that has continuously been waterlogged for about 20 minutes.\n103. After spawning, the Ghastling will try and follow:\n104. Players within a 16-block radius or\n105. An adult, non-aquatic passive mob (and some neutral mobs) within a 16-block radius If no player or suitable mob is close around the Ghastling will idle around within 32 blocks from its home position (where it spawned or last was interacted with).\n106. Can be tempted and fed using Snowballs\n107. Will grow up into a Happy Ghast after about 20 minutes (or faster if fed Snowballs)\n108. Can be summoned using the command: \"/summon happy_ghast ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ minecraft:spawn_baby\"\n109. Spawns from a Ghastling after about 20 minutes (or faster if Ghastling is fed Snowballs)\n110. Can be equipped with a harness and then be mounted by up to 4 players\n111. Tempted by Snowballs and Harness. Harness tempting only works if the Happy Ghast is unharnessed\n112. Has no panic behavior when taking damage\n113. Cannot be bred\n114. Slowly regenerates health, with regeneration speeding up during rain, snow or when flying at the same height as clouds are rendered\n115. The first player that mounts the Happy Ghast will control it, sitting in front of the Happy Ghast, just above its face\n116. When a player mounts, the goggles on the Happy Ghast go down to cover its eyes, indicating that it now can be controlled\n117. Other players who mount after the pilot is mounted, are placed in slots on each side of the Happy Ghast, starting clockwise from the \"pilot\" player\n118. Pressing crouch button dismounts the player on top of the Happy Ghast\n119. If the Happy Ghast detects players on top of it, it then ceases all movement and aligns to the closest cardinal horizontal direction\n120. This happens regardless of it having a harness equipped or not\n121. 3rd person camera is moved back when player is mounted on the Happy Ghast\n122. When there are no players mounted or walking on the Happy Ghast, the goggles go up and the Happy Ghast starts to roam around the home position\n123. If players dismount midair, the Happy Ghast will descend towards the ground before it resumes roaming\n124. Cannot enter boats\n125. Idles around within 64 blocks from its home position (where it spawned or last was interacted with)\n126. If wearing a harness, the Happy Ghast idles closer to the home position (within 32 blocks).\n127. The Happy Ghast will try to stay close to blocks when roaming on its own\n128. Known Issue: The Happy Ghast's health is currently set to 40 when it should be 20. We will be addressing this as soon as possible!\n129. Updated Ghast texture\n130. Crafted out of 3 leather, 2 glass blocks and 1 wool block, the harness will have the same color as the wool block used when crafting\n131. Can be re-dyed\n132. Can only be equipped on a Happy Ghast\n133. Allows up to 4 players to mount the Happy Ghast\n134. Can be removed from the Happy Ghast using Shears but only when no players are mounted\n135. Added the Game Rule command locatorBar to enable or disable the Locator Bar feature\n136. Android: Adreno 640, Mali-G68, Mali-G77, or Xclipse 530 or higher\n137. iOS: A12 or M1 or higher\n138. PC: Running Minecraft on DX12\n139. Some visual corruptions may exist on certain Android devices, particularly with Mali GPUs\n140. Surfaces deeper than eight blocks underwater are dark\n141. Light may leak into underground areas or shadows may pop in and out, especially near cave entrances\n142. Textures may turn pink after suspend and resume, opening Settings, or exiting world\n143. Metallic surfaces might appear with some visual bugs in certain conditions\n144. Emissive surfaces might not glow or appear white in certain conditions\n145. The Locator Bar is a new UI element on the Player HUD that displays the direction of other Players in the World.\n146. When the Locator Bar Experiment is enabled and there are multiple Players in a World, the Locator Bar will appear on-screen for each Player, replacing the Experience Bar. The Player Level number will still be visible as before above the Locator Bar.\n147. The Locator Bar will display colored indicators when the camera is facing within 120 degrees towards another Player. If another Player is 30 degrees above or below the camera's viewport (the screen) an up or down arrow will be displayed.\n148. Crouching will hide the Player, preventing their indicator from appearing on the Locator Bar of other Players.\n149. Players in Spectator Mode are not visible on the Locator Bar.\n150. A Mob Head or a Carved Pumpkin will similarly hide Players from the Locator Bar when worn in the head slot.\n151. Using a Potion of Invisibility will also hide players from the Locator Bar.\n152. Player Dots on the Locator Bar now show correctly regardless of Simulation Distance\n153. Dots are now shown representing Players in Spectator Mode to other Players also in Spectator Mode on the Locator Bar\n154. The Locator Bar has the following known issue, so we recommend testing it with a Simulation Distance of 4 chunks If the Simulation Distance is set to greater than 4 chunks then the Locator Bar may not show players in between 4 chunks and the Simulation Distance\n155. If the Simulation Distance is set to greater than 4 chunks then the Locator Bar may not show players in between 4 chunks and the Simulation Distance\n156. Fixed an issue with BlockPermutation::withState in outdated scripts that prevented some states from being set correctly on a number of blocks Affected blocks include any which have had their directional or placement states recently changed Scripts created after these blocks were changed may need to be updated to avoid unintended behavior\n157.

Fixed Publish to Realms bug by cleaning up local world copy that's created during publish process\n295. Fixed a bug where passing a complex volume with non-contiguous voxels was copying only the contents of the bounding rectangle to the clipboard. Only the specified voxels should have been copied. This now allows us to create structures where air and structure voids are stripped out\n296. Fixed an issue with Freehand select near or outside of dimension bounds that could cause selection to become unusable\n297. Fixed issues with selection volumes being able to translate or resize past world bounds. This also fixes using large brush shapes with freehand selection (and magic select) close to a world boundary\n298.

The minecraft:map_color component underwent a schema change It is now a JSON object with two fields \"color\" and \"tint_method\". \"color\" is a required string field expecting an HEX representation of the RGB, prefixed with a # character. \"tint_method\" is a string field that multiplies the color with a predefined tint. Supported values are \"none, \"default_foliage\", \"birch_foliage\", \"evergreen_foliage\", \"dry_foliage\", \"grass\" and \"water\". the old schema format is still supported for convenience. Examples: \"minecraft:map_color\": { \"color\": \"#ABCDEF\", \"tint_method\": \"grass\" } or \"minecraft:map_color\": { \"color\": \"#ABCDEF\" } or \"minecraft:map_color\": \"#ABCDEF\"\n514.

We recently shipped a couple of service changes behind the scenes (prior to this client update). You may have already experienced them since they have been live for a few weeks now: Persistent game settings: Changes using /gamerule do not persist when a world is unloaded/reloaded ( REALMS-10030 ) We now properly persist game settings updates made in-game via slash commands. Note that there is a bug in the Realms Edit World and in-game pause menu settings screens which causes settings that were adjusted via in-game slash commands to not display properly and also causes changes made in those screens to not save properly. If that happens to you, just run the in-game slash commands again. We are working on a resolution for the UI bug and expect to have it fixed soon. Server hosting region allocation: We are working behind the scenes to improve how Realms are assigned to data center regions. Currently we are only testing these improvements for a subset of players to make sure there are no negative side effects. So far, the change has dramatically reduced network latency, improving the connection of these players to their Realms. We will be sharing a lot more information about this soon when we roll the change out to all Realms. Keep your eyes open!\n140.

For example, using input string \":_input_key.jump:\" will be replaced with \"JUMP\" when using keyboard, or an emoji in case of using a gamepad.\n167. Added full support and fixes for some input glyph replacement strings. This is to make them work across all the platforms (PC, Consoles, Mobile).

    "md": "__**Minecraft: Bedrock Edition 1.21.50 - The Garden Awakens**__\n> Shh! I'm writing this changelog from behind a pale oak tree - and I have to bevery quietbecause the Garden Awakens drop is finally here - and creakings are spawning in pale gardens all across the Overworld! The Garden Awakens brings with it an eerie biome - the pale garden - which is carpeted in moss, filled with pale oak trees, and home to a unique flower called an eyeblossom. It also brings a watchful hostile mob, the creaking, as well as the secret to defeating (and spawning) it - the creaking heart! Facing up to a creaking will also earn you resin clumps - another new block you can craft into resin bricks, or use to trim your armor. Was that everything? Oh! And we've also made some bug fixes. Now, let me see if I can back away slowly without this creaking spotting me...\n\n**Fixes:**\n1. Added Pale Garden Biome, Pale Oak tree, Pale Moss block, Pale Moss carpet, Pale Hanging Moss and Pale Oak wood set\n2. Added Creaking mob, Creaking Spawn Egg and Creaking Heart block\n3. Is active during night and dormant during day\n4. Sends a trail of particles towards the connected Creaking when the Creaking gets hit by the player\n5. When Creaking Heart block is destroyed, the connected Creaking is removed\n6. Creaking Heart cannot be moved by Pistons\n7. Creaking Heart cannot be used as fuel\n8. Creaking Heart spawning and despawning its Creaking emits vibrations from the Creaking's position\n9. Naturally generated Creaking Hearts drop 20 to 24 experience, even when collected with Silk Touch\n10. An activated Creaking will not move if a player is looking at it\n11. Creaking is invulnerable to damage\n12. When hit, a particle trail is shown between the Creaking and the Creaking Heart block it is connected to\n13. When the Creaking Heart block the Creaking is connected to is destroyed, the Creaking is removed\n14. Is not affected by light levels but spawns and despawns based on day/night cycle\n15. Creaking cannot enter Boats\n16. Creaking spawned from a Creaking Heart cannot go through portals\n17. The Creaking Spawn Egg will spawn a Creaking mob that is not connected to a Creaking Heart. The Creaking mob will persist through day and night, loads and saves, and will take damage from attacks and other damage sources. It has one point of health (half a heart)\n18. Creaking summoned from the Creaking Heart cannot be spawned with a spawn egg, nor can it be summoned with commands. It can only exist as a part of the Creaking Heart block\n19. Player wearing a carved pumpkin on their head can look at Creaking without it freezing in place\n20. When a Creaking Heart is destroyed, its Creaking will twitch for a few seconds before crumbling\n21. Creakings spawned by a Creaking Heart will crumble when stuck in a hole with a Player for more than 5 seconds This prevents a potential soft lock, as the invulnerable Creaking would prevent the player from mining or placing any blocks, requiring them to exit and re-enter the world to force the Creaking to despawn\n22. This prevents a potential soft lock, as the invulnerable Creaking would prevent the player from mining or placing any blocks, requiring them to exit and re-enter the world to force the Creaking to despawn\n23.

During the night, Eyeblossoms will become Open\n30. During the day, they will become Closed\n31. In dimensions that do not have a day/night cycle, they will remain as-is\n32. Eyeblossoms planted on the ground will communicate with each other, helping each other to open or close\n33. Open Eyeblossoms have glowing eyes during the night\n34. Eyeblossoms can be obtained by bonemealing the grass in the Pale Garden biome\n35. Bees get poisoned when they interact with Eyeblossoms\n36. Suspicious Stew made from Eyeblossom will have Blindness or Nausea effect depending on the variant\n37. Gray or Orange Dye can be crafted from Closed and Open Eyeblossoms respectively\n38. Eyeblossoms play sounds when opening and closing\n39. Open Eyeblossoms emit ambient sounds when placed on a Pale Moss Block\n40. Open and Closed Eyeblossoms can now be used on Mooshrooms to obtain their respective Suspicious Stews when milking ( MCPE-187754 )\n41. Pale Hanging Moss emits subtle atmospheric sounds when it is attached to Pale Oak Logs and Pale Oak Leaves\n42. Creaking Heart block emits a set of eerie sounds when it is active during night and surrounded by Logs on all sides\n43. Music volume now gradually lowers to zero when entering a Pale Garden and gradually resumes when leaving it\n44. Pale Oak trees generate in this biome\n45.

Pale Hanging Moss does not grow randomly, but can be bone-mealed to grow down\n53. When placed, Pale Moss Carpet grows up to two blocks on the solid faces of any block that borders it\n54. Pale Moss Carpet can be bone-mealed to grow to full on all solid faces of any block that borders it\n55. Pale Oak Saplings can be composted ( MCPE-187457 )\n56. Pale Oak Leaves drop Pale Oak Saplings that can be planted in a 2x2 configuration to grow Pale Oak trees\n57. Pale Oaks logs can be crafted into the Pale Oak wood set: Door Fence Fence Gate Plank Sign Hanging Sign Slab Stairs Trapdoor Wood Stripped Log Stripped Wood Button Pressure Plate Boat Boat with Chest\n58.

Given Hardcore mode brings hardcore stakes, we really can\u2019t recommend backing up your Hardcore worlds enough \u2013 especially if you\u2019ll be playing the new drop on low internet speeds (Read more about these bugshere!). If that wasn\u2019t enough stuff to stuff into a changelog, we\u2019ve also fixed over 140 bugs, increased the spawn rate for bats above ground (because they\u2019re cute, and more players should see them) and made a heap of technical changes for creators.

Jump Boost now increases how high an Entity can jump when using \"behavior.jump_around_target\" ( MCPE-176922 )\n224. Wind Charges now use the minecraft:explode component instead of minecraft:wind_burst\n225. Expanded minecraft:explode with the following new fields: damage_scaling : A scale factor applied to the explosion's damage to entities. A value of 0 prevents the explosion from dealing any damage. Negative values cause the explosion to heal entities instead toggles_blocks : If true, the explosion will toggle blocks in the explosion radius knockback_scaling : A scale factor applied to the knockback force caused by the explosion particle_effect : The name of the particle effect to use. The accepted strings are wind_burst or breeze_wind_burst .

Entities can now no longer move more than 16 blocks in a single tick. (For reference, an entity with Speed 255 will move ~11 blocks in a single tick.)\n265. Game will no longer crash when loading a world near an End City\n266. Worlds created with Experimental Custom Biomes before Caves & Cliffs update will have their Custom Biomes in Chunks replaced with a default Biome (Ocean for Overworld)\n267. Custom biome ids are now assigned with values starting at 30,000 and are stored in 'BiomeIdsTable' in world data so their id assignments persist for the duration of the world\n268. Made a change on Nintendo Switch which may help neighboring chunks to load quicker when player has maximum framerate set ( MCPE-120971 )\n269. Fixed an issue where packs were not downloaded or applied when joining a server that had CDN enabled\n270.

The /locate structure command now uses namespaced structure names. Structure names provided without a namespace will assume the \u201cminecraft\u201d namespace ( MCPE-151807 )\n341. Improved \"behavior.follow_owner\" teleportation logic: Entities now seamlessly resume navigation after teleporting to their owner Added the \"post_teleport_distance\" field, allowing to specify how far from its owner an entity will be placed after teleporting If no value is specified, \"stop_distance\" increased by one will be used These changes only affect entities with format version of 1.21.20 or above\n342. Entities now seamlessly resume navigation after teleporting to their owner\n343. Added the \"post_teleport_distance\" field, allowing to specify how far from its owner an entity will be placed after teleporting If no value is specified, \"stop_distance\" increased by one will be used\n344. If no value is specified, \"stop_distance\" increased by one will be used\n345. These changes only affect entities with format version of 1.21.20 or above\n346. Armor equipped to the second slot of \"minecraft:equippable\" is now applied to \"slot.armor.body\" instead of \"slot.armor.torso\" To retrieve information about it, \"query.armor_texture_slot\", \"query.armor_color_slot\" and \"query.armor_damage_slot\" should now be used with a value of 4 This change only affects entities with a format version equal to or greater than 1.21.10\n347. To retrieve information about it, \"query.armor_texture_slot\", \"query.armor_color_slot\" and \"query.armor_damage_slot\" should now be used with a value of 4\n348. This change only affects entities with a format version equal to or greater than 1.21.10\n349. Added a wind_burst_on_hit subcomponent for Projectiles which creates a wind burst upon collision with an entity or block before being removed from the world\n350. Wind Charges no longer burst when removed by command\n351. Exposed \"minecraft:behavior.swim_up_for_breath\" AI goal component, which allows a mob to try to move to a location where it can breathe air once it is close to running out of its breathable supply In Vanilla, this is used by the Dolphin Any custom content built off of the Vanilla dolphin at or above version 1.21.20 will need to manually add this component to enable this AI behavior\n352. In Vanilla, this is used by the Dolphin\n353. Any custom content built off of the Vanilla dolphin at or above version 1.21.20 will need to manually add this component to enable this AI behavior\n354. Added the \"behavior.teleport_to_owner\" goal, which allows an entity to teleport to its owner This goal is designed for emergency situations where \"behavior.follow_owner\" could be too slow or too low priority The \"filters\" field allows defining the conditions for teleportation using entity filters The \"cooldown\" field allows defining how often the entity should attempt to teleport\n355. This goal is designed for emergency situations where \"behavior.follow_owner\" could be too slow or too low priority\n356. The \"filters\" field allows defining the conditions for teleportation using entity filters\n357. The \"cooldown\" field allows defining how often the entity should attempt to teleport\n358. minecraft:behavior.move_away_from_target has been renamed to minecraft:behavior.move_around_target to better describe what the goal does, since it can be used both for moving away from the target, but also to move towards a random position around the target\n359. Added new entity filter \"owner_distance\", which checks the distance of an entity from its owner\n360. Particle Emitters that use the \"minecraft:particle_appearance_lighting\" component now use the correct light level instead of the world's origin light level\n361. 2 Channel textures in resource packs are now properly supported. When loaded they will always use the first channel to represent all three color channels and the second channel for alpha (I.E A normal texture would be (R, G, B, A) where a 2 channel texture will always be treated as (R, R, R, A) )\n362. Fixed fog JSON validation to allow for max_density_height and zero_density_height values to range from (-64,320)\n363. Trimmed custom armor item icons now appear correctly when their icon texture name includes a namespace or does not match the item name\n364. [BETA] Introduced \"slot.armor.body\" as an extra armor slot for entities like Horses, limited to a single armor item but needing the effects of a full armor set \"slot.armor.body\" is supported by: Commands (even if no suitable item is currently available for manipulation) \"minecraft:attachable\" \"minecraft:interact\" \"query.armor_texture_slot\" (with value 4) \"query.armor_color_slot\" (with value 4) \"query.armor_damage_slot\" (with value 4) \"query.equipment_count\" \"has_equipment\" entity filter (with domain \"body\") \"all_slots_empty\" entity filter (with domain \"body\") \"any_slot_empty\" entity filter (with domain \"body\") \"slot.armor.body\" is not supported by: \"minecraft:wearable\" Future adjustments may alter how items equipped to \"slot.armor.body\" affect entity visibility (intended as how easy an entity is detected by other entities), enchantments, and armor protection\n365. \"slot.armor.body\" is supported by: Commands (even if no suitable item is currently available for manipulation) \"minecraft:attachable\" \"minecraft:interact\" \"query.armor_texture_slot\" (with value 4) \"query.armor_color_slot\" (with value 4) \"query.armor_damage_slot\" (with value 4) \"query.equipment_count\" \"has_equipment\" entity filter (with domain \"body\") \"all_slots_empty\" entity filter (with domain \"body\") \"any_slot_empty\" entity filter (with domain \"body\")\n366.

Introduced the \u201cminecraft:durability_sensor\u201d item component, enabling items to emit sounds and particles when damage causes them to lose durability The \u201cdurability_thresholds\u201d field allows to define a list of both durability thresholds and the effects to emit when they are met When the item receives enough damage to meet multiple thresholds at the same time, only the one corresponding to the lowest durability is considered\n387. The \u201cdurability_thresholds\u201d field allows to define a list of both durability thresholds and the effects to emit when they are met\n388. When the item receives enough damage to meet multiple thresholds at the same time, only the one corresponding to the lowest durability is considered\n389. Learning portal documents on these features and how to use them are being written and will be available soon\n390. Released state_time which no longer requires the 'Upcoming Creator Features' toggle\n391. Fixed Molang content errors to include the expression in the logged message\n392. The Oak-Slab-looking variation of \"stone_block_slab\" (aux value 2) is now flattened into its own new block \"minecraft:petrified_oak_slab\" ( MCPE-180964 ) Will behave like other Stone Slabs, eg. cannot be destroyed by fire, but will look like an ordinary oak slab \"minecraft:petrified_oak_slab\" can only be obtained and placed through commands\n393.

Check out the highlights from this release:\n\n**Fixes:**\n1. Wolves now have double the amount of health than they used to\n2. Experimental: Upcoming 1.21 features, including the Bogged, Wind Charge, and Vault\n3. Wolves can now withstand the same amount of damage as in Java Edition ( MCPE-177613 ) Rather than halving all damage dealt to tamed Wolves by entities other than Players or Arrows, as currently done in Java Edition, the maximum health of tamed Wolves has been increased from 20 to 40 Pre-existing tamed Wolves will need to be fed to reach the new maximum health To ensure the healing rate remains consistent, the health restored by feeding Wolves has been doubled Java Edition will be adjusted to match the new Bedrock Edition implementation\n4. Rather than halving all damage dealt to tamed Wolves by entities other than Players or Arrows, as currently done in Java Edition, the maximum health of tamed Wolves has been increased from 20 to 40\n5. Pre-existing tamed Wolves will need to be fed to reach the new maximum health\n6. To ensure the healing rate remains consistent, the health restored by feeding Wolves has been doubled\n7. Java Edition will be adjusted to match the new Bedrock Edition implementation\n8. Become the Breeze! Using a Wind Charge will fire off a Wind Charge projectile similar to the Breeze's\n9. A Wind Charge fired by a player will grant 10% more knockback than a Breeze's\n10. Just like the projectile fired by the Breeze, Wind Charges fired by the player also deal damage if they hit an entity directly\n11. The Breeze drops between 4-6 Wind Charges when killed\n12. Wind Charges have a max stack size of 64\n13. There is half a second cooldown after each use\n14. Wind Charges can be fired from a dispenser\n15. Players that launch themselves with a Wind Charge only accumulate fall damage below the y-level of where they collided with the wind burst\n16. A new variant of Skeletons that shoot poisonous arrows They're faster to take down with 16 health instead of 20 health They attack at a slower interval of 3.5 seconds instead of 2 seconds\n17.

Found throughout Trial Chambers, containing the structures' most valuable loot\n24. Vaults in Trial Chambers require a Trial Key to be unlocked\n25. Can be unlocked by an unlimited amount of players After a player has unlocked a Vault, they cannot unlock that Vault again If a player has not unlocked that Vault before, an orange stream of particles will flow from the player to the Vault when nearby\n26. After a player has unlocked a Vault, they cannot unlock that Vault again\n27. If a player has not unlocked that Vault before, an orange stream of particles will flow from the player to the Vault when nearby\n28. Has a keyhole that will be open or closed depending on the players nearby If any nearby player has not unlocked that Vault, the keyhole will be open If all nearby players have unlocked that Vault, the keyhole will be closed\n29. If any nearby player has not unlocked that Vault, the keyhole will be open\n30. If all nearby players have unlocked that Vault, the keyhole will be closed\n31. Within its cage, it will cycle through and display items which are possible to eject from its loot table\n32. The rewards it ejects are randomized from its loot table each time it is unlocked\n33. Vaults currently reuse the same loot table that reward chests previously used in the Trial Chambers This loot table is temporary and will be completely revised as development continues\n34. This loot table is temporary and will be completely revised as development continues\n35. Cannot be crafted or obtained in Survival mode, and does not drop anything when mined\n36. Explosion-resistant and cannot be moved\n37. The collars of tamed Wolves have been increased in size, making them visible not only from the front but also from other angles\n38. Fixed a bug that could cause the loading screen to get stuck for some time around 40% ( MCPE-175550 )\n39. Fixed an issue where the game could softlock while displaying the \"Loading resource packs\" modal\n40. Fixed an issue that could cause the game to freeze when changing languages on some platforms\n41. Upward player motion will now reset fall distance, allowing Riptide Tridents to break a fall ( MCPE-126454 )\n42. Players can now bridge blocks over water ( MCPE-163165 )\n43. Fixed sky light not being updated properly when big gaps of air were present between the ceiling and the floor\n44. Fixed a bug that could sometimes prevent the Stronghold portal room from being generated ( MCPE-19426 )\n45. Fixed players not unlocking \u201cThe Beginning\u201d trophy on PlayStation for defeating a Wither, even if they were close enough to the Wither\n46. When fed, baby mobs now emit both sound and particles\n47. All sounds emitted by Phantoms are now audible even when the player is facing away ( MCPE-133125 )\n48.

Fixed a bug that made it so players could not place multiple items while moving, such as Boats or Fireworks ( MCPE-178063 , MCPE-178077 )\n58. As a result of this fix, we've had to revert the fix for Slabs and Stairs being placed inconsistently while continuously building ( MCPE-54855 ). We'll work to reintroduce a fix for this in an upcoming update\n59. In Realms, removing an item from an Item Frame while in Creative mode no longer destroys the Item Frame ( REALMS-10464 )\n60.

The Breeze is a cunning, hostile mob that can spawn via Trial Spawner in some rooms within Trial Chambers\n10. The Breeze moves primarily by leaping around a target, sometimes jumping quite long distances\n11. An aggressive adversary, the Breeze shoots volatile wind energy in the form of wind charge projectiles at its target\n12. Wind charges deal a small amount of damage when colliding directly with an entity\n13. After colliding with an entity or a block, wind charge projectiles produce a wind burst, which knocks back entities in the area by several blocks\n14. Wind bursts also have the effect of 'activating' certain blocks: Non-Iron Doors and Trapdoors are flipped Fence Gates are flipped Buttons are pressed Levers are flipped Bells are rung and swung Lit Candles (both standalone and on cake) are extinguished\n15.

It can only spawn a mob at positions that are within line of sight\n27. It can spawn a mob regardless of any light level requirement the mob has\n28. Spawned mobs are persistent\n29. Once all mobs are defeated, the Trial Spawner will eject a set of rewards proportional to the current challenge level After the rewards have been ejected, the Trial Spawner goes into cooldown for 30 minutes during which it will no longer spawn mobs\n30. After the rewards have been ejected, the Trial Spawner goes into cooldown for 30 minutes during which it will no longer spawn mobs\n31. Trial Spawners cannot be crafted nor obtained by players in Survival - instead, they can be found naturally placed throughout Trial Chambers\n32. Trial Spawners are extremely slow to mine and resistant to explosions, and will not drop even with Silk Touch\n33. When placed in Creative, Trial Spawners have no mob type set by default The mob type can be set by interacting with it while holding a Spawn Egg\n34. The mob type can be set by interacting with it while holding a Spawn Egg\n35. Creative and Spectator players cannot be detected or noticed by Trial Spawners\n36.

Supply chests can be found between different rooms, and give you blocks and items which help you navigate your trials\n41. Reward chests are guarded by challenges in each room, and can be a source of enchanted books and equipment\n42. The loot found in reward chests are still being iterated, and are absolutely not final\n43. Each Trial Chamber will include Trial Spawners with a melee, small melee, or ranged category: Melee Zombie Husk Slime Small Melee Spider Cave Spider Baby Zombie Silverfish Ranged Skeleton Stray Each Trial Spawner category will only use one mob for the entire structure when generated, and these mobs are randomized for each Trial Chamber For example, one Trial Chamber might only spawn Zombies, Cave Spiders and Strays, while another might only spawn Slimes, Silverfish and Skeletons The exceptions to this are some Trial Spawners in unique rooms which always spawn Breezes\n44.

The command for unlocking recipes has been updated. The autosuggestion to give a player a recipe now says \"player: target\" instead of \"victim: target\" ( MCPE-172402 )\n13. \u2018Recipe unlocked\u2019 message is no longer visible on the pause menu ( MCPE-171112 )\n14.

This change will enable experienced players to find items they are looking for (even if it hasn't been unlocked yet) while not overwhelming new players with recipes they aren't yet ready for.\n24. These changes are planned for both Bedrock and Java Edition, but they are still being tweaked and we definitely want to hear your feedback! Send us your thoughts at aka.ms/MinecraftRecipeSearch\n25.

We have adjusted the breaking times of 188 blocks to match Java Edition and our intended design. Some blocks couldn't be changed yet for technical reasons and Obsidian was left unchanged because we're still deciding what breaking speed it should have. Bringing more blocks to parity makes it easier for our team to keep both versions up to date. We also hope it will be easier for the community to make and share guides that work for all players on all platforms. The full list of block breaking times and changes can be found at the very end of this changelog\n29.

This update includes experimental changes to the Wandering Trader and Librarian Villager trades. You must turn on this experiment in the Experiments Menu if you want to test the new trades.\n62. We are trying out these changes to rebalance the villager trade system and make it more fair and fun for everyone. However, these changes are not yet final, and they will stay as experimental features while we continue to work on them. We still need your feedback to help us improve and decide, so please continue to let us know what you think of the new trades, what you like and dislike, and what suggestions you have at aka.ms/VillagerTradingFeedback .\n63. Before these changes, players could get any Village enchantment from any Librarian. A novice Librarian could sell the best enchantment in the game! For some players, this felt too random and made trading feel overpowered when compared to using the Enchanting Table or searching for Enchanted Books in structures.\n64. With the new rules, Librarians from different biomes sell different enchantments. Master Librarians are guaranteed to have a special enchantment which is different in each Village biome.\n65. Players will have to work towards getting the best trades instead of relying on random chance. We hope this makes Librarian trading more interesting and skilful, while also revealing some clues about their history of each Village type through the enchantments that are sold there.\n66. Librarians from different biomes now sell different Enchanted Books\n67. Master Librarians with full XP are guaranteed to sell a special enchantment, which is different in each Village biome\n68.

Some enchantments have been removed from Village trading and must be found in other ways\n72. Some players felt that the Wandering Trader had unfair prices and didn't sell many useful items. We have lowered their prices, added more trades, and increased the amounts available. The Wandering Trader will also now buy useful items from players, so it's possible to help them on their journey by giving them supplies even if you don't feel like buying anything.\n73. As this is an experiment, we would really appreciate your feedback as work continues and to help us decide on the future direction for Villager trades!\n74. Wandering Traders now have lower prices and have a higher amount of each item in stock\n75. Wandering Traders now sell Logs\n76. Wandering Traders can now buy many items, instead of only selling\n77. Increased the amount of Diamond Ore found in the deepest parts of the world. Our goal is to make it more rewarding to mine for Diamonds in the Deepslate layers\n78.

When placed on Moss, the Egg will hatch in approximately 10 minutes\n67. On all other blocks, it will hatch in approximately 20 minutes\n68. The Sniffer can occasionally sniff up a Torchflowers seed, and it can be used to breed two Sniffers\n69. The Torchflower seed can be planted on Farmland and grows into a Torchflower\n70. The full-grown flower can be harvested and replanted\n71. The Torchflower can be crafted into Orange Dye\n72. The Sniffer can occasionally sniff up a Pitcher Pod item\n73. The Pitcher Pod, when planted on Farmland, grows into a Pitcher Crop\n74. The Pitcher Crop has five growth stages\n75. Once fully grown, the Pitcher Crop can be harvested, yielding a two-block-tall Pitcher Plant\n76. The Pitcher Plant can be crafted into Cyan Dye\n77. Smithing Tables have been redesigned into a workstation for physical equipment upgrades and modifications\n78. Alongside slots for combining a piece of equipment and materials, there is now a required slot for an item type called Smithing Template\n79. Smithing Templates define what type of upgrade you will be making to a piece of equipment It specifies both what type of items you can upgrade, and which ingredients are valid to customize the upgrade There are currently two categories of Smithing Templates: Armor Trim and Netherite Upgrade\n80. It specifies both what type of items you can upgrade, and which ingredients are valid to customize the upgrade\n81. There are currently two categories of Smithing Templates: Armor Trim and Netherite Upgrade\n82. Smithing Templates are consumed when used to upgrade an item in the Smithing Table\n83. You can craft a copy of a Smithing Template in the Crafting Table with 7 diamonds + 1 block of material that the template is made out of + 1 smithing template, which will output 2 of the same Smithing Template\n84. You can now visually customize your armor with a variety of unique trims at the Smithing Table\n85. Armor trims are purely visual with no gameplay benefits\n86. Armor trims can be applied to Helmets, Chestplates, Leggings and Boots All trim patterns are visually the same on an armor's item icon, but the color will still change based on the trim material To check which trim pattern a piece of armor has, you can hover over it in the inventory\n87. All trim patterns are visually the same on an armor's item icon, but the color will still change based on the trim material\n88. To check which trim pattern a piece of armor has, you can hover over it in the inventory\n89. Armor Trim Smithing Templates can be found all throughout the world, and each of the following structures contain their own unique Smithing Templates: Trail Ruins: Wayfinder, Raiser, Shaper, and Host Armor Trims Pillager Outpost: Sentry Armor Trim Desert Pyramid: Dune Armor Trim Shipwreck: Coast Armor Trim Jungle Temple: Wild Armor Trim Ocean Monument: Tide Armor Trim Ancient City: Ward and Silence Armor Trims Woodland Mansion: Vex Armor Trim Nether Fortress: Rib Armor Trim Bastion Remnant: Snout Armor Trim Stronghold: Eye Armor Trim End City: Spire Armor Trim\n90.

Trail Ruins have no chests, Smithing Templates are instead found by brushing Suspicious Gravel\n104. The Ocean Monument has no chests, Elder Guardians sometimes instead drop a Smithing Template upon death\n105. Some Armor Trim Smithing Templates are rarer than others, so be on the lookout for them to impress your friends!\n106. An armor trim has two properties: a pattern and a material The pattern is defined by the Smithing Template used to apply the trim, and represents the visual pattern of the trim The material is defined by which ingredient you used to apply the trim, and controls the color of the trim\n107. The pattern is defined by the Smithing Template used to apply the trim, and represents the visual pattern of the trim\n108. The material is defined by which ingredient you used to apply the trim, and controls the color of the trim\n109. The viable ingredients you can use to define the color of your armor trim are the following: Iron, Copper, Gold, Lapis, Emerald, Diamond, Netherite, Redstone, Amethyst, Quartz\n110. Iron, Copper, Gold, Lapis, Emerald, Diamond, Netherite, Redstone, Amethyst, Quartz\n111. Netherite equipment crafting now also requires a Netherite Upgrade Smithing Template\n112. Netherite Upgrade Smithing Templates can be found randomly in all Bastion Remnant chests Every Treasure Room Bastion Remnant will contain 2 Smithing Templates\n113. Every Treasure Room Bastion Remnant will contain 2 Smithing Templates\n114. This change was made for a variety of reasons: Increase the time players utilize Diamond equipment before Netherite Make Netherite equipment more significant achievement in the game's progression Adapt Netherite more naturally into the new Smithing Table crafting system\n115. Increase the time players utilize Diamond equipment before Netherite\n116. Make Netherite equipment more significant achievement in the game's progression\n117. Adapt Netherite more naturally into the new Smithing Table crafting system\n118. Camels can be equipped with a Saddle and ridden by two players\n119. Camels spawn naturally when Desert Villages generate\n120. Camels can be tempted by holding Cactus\n121. Feed Cactus to Camels to breed them\n122.

When put in a Jukebox, Relic by Aaron Cherof is played\n147. A new variant of Sculk Sensors which allows you to filter vibrations based on their frequency level\n148. They are not found naturally and can only be crafted with 1 Sculk Sensor and 3 Amethyst Shards in the Crafting Table\n149. One side of the Calibrated Sculk Sensor can receive a redstone signal as input The strength of that redstone signal is the only vibration frequency the Sculk Sensor will listen to\n150. The strength of that redstone signal is the only vibration frequency the Sculk Sensor will listen to\n151. They have a combined active and cooldown phase that lasts 20 game ticks They output their redstone signal for the first 10 game ticks\n152. They output their redstone signal for the first 10 game ticks\n153. They can detect vibrations up to 16 blocks away\n154. Sculk Sensors and Calibrated Sculk Sensors now have three phases: Inactive, Active, and Cooldown\n155. The default phase is Inactive This phase lasts indefinitely until the block receives a vibration During this phase, the block is able to listen to nearby vibrations until one has been scheduled\n156. This phase lasts indefinitely until the block receives a vibration\n157. During this phase, the block is able to listen to nearby vibrations until one has been scheduled\n158. When a scheduled vibration is received, the block switches to the Active phase This phase lasts 30 game ticks for Sculk Sensors, and 10 game ticks for Calibrated Sculk Sensors During this phase, the block stops listening to nearby vibrations, wiggles its tendrils, and emits a Redstone signal and light\n159. This phase lasts 30 game ticks for Sculk Sensors, and 10 game ticks for Calibrated Sculk Sensors\n160. During this phase, the block stops listening to nearby vibrations, wiggles its tendrils, and emits a Redstone signal and light\n161. After the Active phase has finished, the block switches to a Cooldown phase This phase lasts for 10 game ticks During this phase, the block keeps wiggling its tendrils, but no longer emits a Redstone signal nor light Finally, once this phase is finished, the block will switch back to the Inactive phase\n162. This phase lasts for 10 game ticks\n163. During this phase, the block keeps wiggling its tendrils, but no longer emits a Redstone signal nor light\n164. Finally, once this phase is finished, the block will switch back to the Inactive phase\n165. Previously, these phases had different timings: The Active phase lasted 40 game ticks for Sculk Sensors and 20 game ticks for Calibrated Sculk Sensors There was no Cooldown phase\n166. The Active phase lasted 40 game ticks for Sculk Sensors and 20 game ticks for Calibrated Sculk Sensors\n167. There was no Cooldown phase\n168. These phase timings were tweaked so that it is less common for activated contraptions to recursively activate the Sculk Sensor that powered them\n169. Blocks of Amethyst have a new behavior when placed adjacent to Sculk Sensors If that Sculk Sensor receives a vibration, the Block of Amethyst will re-emit its frequency as a separate vibration at its location\n170. If that Sculk Sensor receives a vibration, the Block of Amethyst will re-emit its frequency as a separate vibration at its location\n171. This behaviour is called Vibration Resonance, and allows players to move vibration frequencies across long distances without having to recreate the vibration naturally\n172. With the addition of Calibrated Sculk Sensors, vibration frequencies have been greatly simplified to prevent unwanted interference\n173. The following are category descriptions for each frequency and the expected events that they correspond to: Movement in any medium (land, liquid or air) Landing on any surface (land or liquid) Item interactions Gliding with an Elytra or unique mob actions (Ravager roaring, Wolf shaking, etc.) Equipping gear Interacting with a mob Mobs and players getting damaged Consuming items (drinking and eating) Blocks 'deactivating' (Door closing, Chest closing, Button unpressing, etc.) Blocks 'activating' (Door opening, Chest opening, Button being pressed, etc.) Blocks changing (Cauldron water level rising, adding food to a Campfire, etc.) Blocks being destroyed Blocks being placed Mobs and players spawning Mobs and players dying or an explosion\n174. Movement in any medium (land, liquid or air)\n175. Landing on any surface (land or liquid)\n176. Item interactions\n177.

Blocks being placed\n187. Mobs and players spawning\n188. Mobs and players dying or an explosion\n189. When placing a Mob Head on a Note Block, that Note Block will now play one of the ambient sounds of that mob when played by a player or powered by Redstone\n190. Mob Heads can be placed on top of Note Blocks without sneaking\n191. Piglins will now drop their heads when killed by a charged Creeper\n192. Placing the Piglin head on a Note Block will play one of the Piglin's ambient sounds\n193. The Piglin head will flap its ears when powered by Redstone, or when worn by a player while walking\n194.

System Events Further separation of events into distinct before* and after* handling, with some restrictions on the execution of state updates in a before event: All before events moved from world.events into world.beforeEvents property . The \"before\" prefix has been removed. Functions that alter world state are prohibited in before event callbacks. Read-only methods and properties are allowed. Set methods are limited to the event object itself. Any use of restricted methods and properties will throw an exception. For example, system.events.beforeWatchdogTerminate is now considered a \"before\" event. Functions that alter world state are prohibited in before event callbacks. Read-only methods and properties are allowed. Set methods are limited to the event object itself. Any use of restricted methods and properties will throw an exception For example, system.events.scriptEventReceived is now considered an \"after\" event. After event callbacks are executed in a deferred manner. Using /scriptEvent something will queue script to execute at a later point\n328.

You can now visually customize your armor with a variety of unique trims at the Smithing Table\n22. Armor Trims are purely visual with no gameplay benefits, and can only be applied to Helmets, Chestplates, Leggings, and Boots All trim patterns are visually the same on an armor's item icon, but the color will still change based on the trim material To check which trim pattern a piece of armor has, you can hover over it in the inventory\n23. All trim patterns are visually the same on an armor's item icon, but the color will still change based on the trim material\n24. To check which trim pattern a piece of armor has, you can hover over it in the inventory\n25. An Armor Trim has two properties: a pattern and a material The pattern is defined by the Smithing Template used to apply the trim, and represents the visual pattern of the trim The material is defined by what ingredient you used to apply the trim, and represents the color of the trim\n26. The pattern is defined by the Smithing Template used to apply the trim, and represents the visual pattern of the trim\n27. The material is defined by what ingredient you used to apply the trim, and represents the color of the trim\n28. The viable ingredients you can use to define the color of your Armor Trim are the following: Iron Copper Gold Lapis Emerald Diamond Netherite Redstone Amethyst Quartz\n29. Iron\n30. Copper\n31. Gold\n32. Lapis\n33. Emerald\n34. Diamond\n35. Netherite\n36. Redstone\n37. Amethyst\n38. Quartz\n39. Smithing Tables have been redesigned into a workstation for physical equipment upgrades and modifications\n40. Alongside slots for combining a piece of equipment and materials, there is now a required slot for an item type called Smithing Templates\n41. Smithing Templates define what type of upgrade you will be making to equipment It specifies both what type of items you can upgrade, and which ingredients are valid to customize the upgrade There are currently two categories of Smithing Templates: Armor Trim and Netherite Upgrade\n42. It specifies both what type of items you can upgrade, and which ingredients are valid to customize the upgrade\n43. There are currently two categories of Smithing Templates: Armor Trim and Netherite Upgrade\n44. Armor Trim Smithing Templates can be found all throughout the world, and each of the following structures contain their own unique Smithing Template: Pillager Outpost: Sentry Armor Trim Desert Pyramid: Dune Armor Trim Shipwreck: Coast Armor Trim Jungle Temple: Wild Armor Trim Ocean Monument: Tide Armor Trim Ancient City: Ward Armor Trim Woodland Mansion: Vex Armor Trim Nether Fortress: Rib Armor Trim Bastion Remnant: Snout Armor Trim Stronghold: Eye Armor Trim End City: Spire Armor Trim Trail Ruins: Wayfinder Armor Trim, Raiser Armor Trim, Shaper Armor Trim, Host Armor Trim Ancient City: Silence Armor Trim\n45. Pillager Outpost: Sentry Armor Trim\n46. Desert Pyramid: Dune Armor Trim\n47. Shipwreck: Coast Armor Trim\n48. Jungle Temple: Wild Armor Trim\n49. Ocean Monument: Tide Armor Trim\n50.

End City: Spire Armor Trim\n56. Trail Ruins: Wayfinder Armor Trim, Raiser Armor Trim, Shaper Armor Trim, Host Armor Trim\n57. Ancient City: Silence Armor Trim\n58. Smithing Templates are found in Chests in their respective structure, except for the Ocean Monument. Instead of finding it in Chests, Elder Guardians sometimes drop a Smithing Template when defeated\n59. Some Armor Trim Smithing Templates are rarer than others, so be on the lookout for them to impress your friends!\n60. Smithing Templates are consumed when used to upgrade an item in the Smithing Table\n61. You can craft a copy of a Smithing Template in the Crafting Table with 7 Diamonds + 1 block of material that the template is made out of + 1 Smithing Template, which will output 2 of the same Smithing Template\n62. Netherite equipment crafting now also requires a Netherite Upgrade Smithing Template\n63. Netherite Upgrade Smithing Templates can be found randomly in all Bastion Remnant chests, and there is a guarantee of 2 in every Treasure Room Bastion Remnant\n64. This change was made for a variety of reasons: Increases the time players utilize Diamond equipment before Netherite Make Netherite equipment a more significant achievement in the game's progression Adapts Netherite more naturally into the new Smithing Table crafting system\n65.

Adapts Netherite more naturally into the new Smithing Table crafting system\n68. A new variant of Sculk Sensors which allows you to filter vibrations based on their frequency level. They are not found naturally and can only be crafted\n69. They can be crafted with 1 Sculk Sensor and 3 Amethyst Shards in the Crafting Table\n70. One side of the Calibrated Sculk Sensor can receive a Redstone signal as input The strength of that Redstone signal is the only vibration frequency the Sculk Sensor will listen to\n71. The strength of that Redstone signal is the only vibration frequency the Sculk Sensor will listen to\n72. Blocks of Amethyst have a new behavior when placed adjacent to Sculk Sensors\n73. If that Sculk Sensor receives a vibration, the Block of Amethyst will re-emit its frequency as a separate vibration at its location\n74. This behaviour is called Vibration Resonance, and allows players to move vibration frequencies across long distances without having to recreate the vibration naturally\n75. Signs have improved customization options\n76. Sign text can now be edited after being placed in the world This can be done by interacting with the Sign\n77.

Or hit it with your fist to pick up the pot without breaking it.\n35. Desert Temples and Desert Wells now contain Suspicious Sand. This fragile block is hard to spot and easy to destroy, so be careful!\n36. If you manage to find the Suspicious Sand and brush it with your Brush, you will extract objects that were buried long ago.\n37. We're giving you an early look at these Archaeology features.

Scrolling the inventory screen is easier as the dwell time has been increased to 180 milliseconds (was 120 previously). The dwell time is the length of time an item must be held before a drag action begins\n101. Untangled the connections between \"Lock Joystick\", \"Joystick Always Visible\", and \"Joystick Visible When Unused\"\n102. Added toggle \"Delayed Block Breaking (Creative Only)\" in Touch Settings to control this functionality\n103. Fixed an issue where double tapping touch control buttons can be difficult on high refresh rate screens ( MCPE-156351 )\n104. Improved the way that button presses and camera movements work in tandem in the new Touch Controls\n105. Action buttons now show up when in a Boat while using Crosshair mode ( MCPE-159376 )\n106.

Resolved an issue where players couldn't interact with the hotbar in some resource packs with the new touch controls ( MCPE-157748 )\n111. The sprint and descend buttons in Crosshair Mode now have the same colour as other buttons ( MCPE-156740 )\n112. Resolved an issue where quickly tapping \"Ascend\" and \"Descend\" would cancel flying in the new touch controls. Going forward, double tapping \"Descend\" is how flying is cancelled ( MCPE-162240 )\n113. Status icons now follow the screen safe zone when in touch mode\n114. Adjusted status icons to form in one row across width of screen when in touch to account for new touch controls\n115. Removed the action delay from Attack and Interact buttons ( MCPE-158143 )\n116. When the joystick is unlocked, the draggable range has been changed to be the same as the when the joystick is locked. In both modes, if auto-sprinting is enabled, it will start when the joystick is dragged slightly above the background. The auto-sprint will disengage if the joystick control is subsequently moved back into the joystick background area\n117. A tap gesture will now fire a charged Crossbow. Previously, it was necessary to hold the gesture for 400ms before the bolt would fire\n118. Fixed an issue where players couldn't drag/drop on the Anvil screen\n119. Applied ambient light to blocks moved by Pistons ( MCPE-136928 )\n120. Mob shadows now render properly on Android devices using certain GPUs ( MCPE-155354 )\n121.

Fixed a bug on the Pocket UI Inventory screen where items could not be dropped back into the inventory in Creative Mode\n128. Fixed a bug on the Pocket UI Inventory screen where the \u2018Craftable/All\u2019 toggle could only be changed in the Search tab but not in any other tab\n129. On Xbox, camera movement with mouse no longer changes mouse position when the inventory screen is reopened ( MCPE-162890 )\n130.

Changed the color of the description text for the \u201cAllow mobile data for online play\u201d option to be more readable ( MCPE-162459 )\n134. Fixed a contrast issue of the little arrow in dropdown components on hover, the unselected toggle components and the toggle/sliders in chat settings\n135. Updated Add-On templates for19.50 with new resources, behaviors, and documentation are available to download at aka.ms/MCAddonPacks\n136. Structure Blocks can now import structures from \u2018.mcstructure\u2019 files on Windows\n137. Actor (Entity) Properties are no longer experimental (This includes Molang queries and property filters, but not Permutations)\n138. Fixed a crash that would occur if the texture_index of a spawn egg was out of bounds. Now a content log error will be presented instead\n139. Min/Max distance values in sound events now only affect the sound event and not all events using the same sound ( MCPE-154376 )\n140. Added client-side-chunk-generation-enabled toggle to server.properties\n141. Fixed an issue where changing the subpack of Resource Packs that have subpacks would not apply changes until the game was restarted ( MCPE-162002 )\n142. Recipes that have the same inputs but have different outputs will now display content errors (excludes Crafting Table and Stonecutter recipes)\n143. Removed the Upcoming Creator Features requirement for the new execute command syntax\n144. Version 1.19.50 is now required to run the new command syntax\n145. Creators currently using the new execute command syntax in command blocks will have to go modify those command blocks in order to update those commands\n146. Creators currently using the new execute command in behavior packs will need to change the min engine version to 1.19.50\n147. The previous execute command syntax can still be used by using version 1.19.40 or less\n148. Using the '/enchant' command to apply the same level of enchantment no longer results in a higher level being applied ( MCPE-153204 )\n149. Fixed an issue where hasItem wouldn't correctly detect an item with a data value if hasItem wasn't provided a data value ( MCPE-162460 )\n150. Running '/execute as' from Command Blocks no longer inherits rotation from entity ( MCPE-162680 )\n151. Fixed a bug where Chain Command Blocks would not activate when Delay in Ticks was greater than 0\n152.

Released BlockCollisionBoxComponent outside of experimental toggle in JSON formats 1.19.50 and higher\n154. Released BlockCraftingTableComponent outside of experimental toggle in JSON formats 1.19.50 and higher\n155. The Crafting Table UI now updates when a block changes to a permutation with a different \u201cminecraft:crafting_table\u201d block component\n156. Removed the functionality of the \u201cminecraft:breathability\u201d block component. Component will have no effect on the custom defined block\n157. Blocks using the \"minecraft:placement_filter\" component now produce particles, sounds and vibrations events when they are removed due to their placement condition failing\n158. \"input_ground_controlled\" no longer implies increased auto step when controlled by player. The \"variable_max_auto_step\" component can be used instead. To have consistency with previous versions, use \"base_value\": 1.0625 and \"jump_prevented_value\": 0.5625\n159. Added server property 'enable-lan-visibility' to disable the explicit LAN discovery by clients. This will prevent unexpected port conflicts when running multiple dedicated servers on a single host. Clarified port use in server logs and made error messaging more clear ( BDS-1094 )\n160. Exposed new data parameters for the \"minecraft:offer_flower\" AI behaviour to specify such things as the time that the mob offers the flower for, the chance that the goal will start, and the dimensions of the AABB used to search for a mob to offer a flower to\n161. The \"minecraft:offer_flower\" AI behavior can now be used by any mob, not just the Iron Golem\n162. The \"minecraft:offer_flower\" AI behavior will now search through all mobs in the specified range rather than just the closest one, meaning that this goal has the potential to be used more consistently than before\n163. Exposed new data parameters for the \"minecraft:take_flower\" AI behavior to specify such things as the conditions to be met to start the goal, the min and max wait times before taking the flower, and the dimensions of the AABB used to search for a mob to take a flower from\n164. The \"minecraft:take_flower\" AI behavior can now be used by any mob, not just baby Villagers\n165. Fixed has_property to return 1 when a property exists and 0 when not, rather than the opposite of that\n166. Fixed velocity property not returning correct values in certain situations ( MCPE-152715 )\n167. Added function canPlace - Returns if it is valid to place the desired block type or block permutation at a specified location (and optional face of the block)\n168. Added function trySetPermutation - Attempts to place the desired block permutation at a location by first checking canPlace\n169. Entity Removed function runCommand .

    "md": "__**Minecraft - The Wild Update - 1.19.0 (Bedrock)**__\n> Set your sights for adventure, wander aimlessly, or seek out something new in The Wild Update!\n\n**Fixes:**\n1. Tread carefully in the deep dark or risk waking a warden\n2. Climb to the top of a mangrove tree and leap through the swamps with Frogs\n3. Find allays to help gather items\n4. Added several new music tracks to enjoy during gameplay\n5. Fixed over 40 bugs, issues, and parity changes\n6. In the depths of the Overworld, you will find one of the scariest biomes in all of Minecraft. Buried undergound, especially at the bottom of mountainous regions, this area is filled with sculk blocks, ancient structures, loot chests, and one, single, solitary mob. To navigate the deep dark, you need to sneak, use Silk Touch, and above all else \u2013 don\u2019t wake the warden!\n7. The only mob that spawns in the deep dark is none other than the warden. The warden will only make an appearance if its slumber is disturbed, which means that brave explorers must sneak around very quietly. Quick movements risk setting off a sculk sensor that trigger a sculk shrieker. If you have the misfortune of hearing it pierce through the silent shroud of the deep dark, it\u2019s time to get out. Even though the warden can\u2019t see, this doesn\u2019t slow it down but works to its advantage. The warden can sniff out any intruders and uses vibrations to detect their exact location.\n8. There are five different types of sculk blocks to be found in the deep dark. If you want to mine them, you will need to stay stealthy and use Silk Touch. The sculk block is a great decorative block thanks to its atmospheric glow. The sculk sensor is a redstone block that detects vibrations, so walk carefully or use a wool block to muffle your steps. The sculk catalyst spreads sculk around it and sculk veins generate around patches of sculk that spawn from the sculk catalyst. Finally, the sculk shrieker is possibly the most dangerous block of all since it will summon the warden if you\u2019re not careful!\n9. The recovery compass is the solution for finding the way back to the last location you died. Loot chests in ancient cities to discover echo shards and craft one for yourself!\n10. Towering trees, wide roots, small saplings, and muddy terrain make up the new mangrove swamps. Found in areas with high temperatures and high humidity, this new swamp also introduces mangrove trees and mud blocks, bringing a wide range of new materials to craft builds inspired by the beauty of the Overworld!\n11. Mangrove trees introduce a brand-new type of wood block to build with, the logs can be crafted into planks, stairs, buttons, slabs, fences, doors, signs, and pressure plates. You can also craft with the mangrove tree\u2019s leaves, roots, and small saplings called propagules!\n12. Mud can be found all over mangrove swamps and crafted with wheat into packed mud! Use it to craft a variety of mud brick blocks including stairs, slabs, and walls. This block is also renewable by using a water bottle on dirt, so there is no risk of running out of mud. Placing Mud above a block that has pointed dripstone underneath will eventually turn the mud block into clay!\n13. Frogs feed on small slimes, breathe on land and in water, and lay eggs called frogspawn. The eggs will hatch and turn into tadpoles, making this the first mob that isn\u2019t bred from a smaller version of itself! There are three different types to discover \u2013 temperate frogs, warm frogs, and cold frogs \u2013 so getting your hands on all three means that you will need to travel through the Overworld!\n14. These luminous blocks come in three different variants depending on which frog type produces it. If you want to light up your base with ochre, verdant, or pearlescent froglights, you will need to figure out a way to feed a frog a very small magma cube!\n15. The winner of the Minecraft Live 2021 Mob Vote is flying into Minecraft! Instantly recognizable by its luminous blue sheen, you won\u2019t lose this mob once you find it. Hand it an item and it will pick up matching items it finds in the world. It loves music and will drop items if it hears a note block playing nearby. The allay spawns in pillager outposts and woodland mansions and is waiting for you to set it free!\n16. The Wild Update makes it possible for you to craft a boat with a chest on it, which is convenient since there are plenty of new blocks to bring back from your new adventures!\n17. Dropped by goats that ram into hard blocks and can be used to make a variety of sounds! Can you find all eight variants?\n18. Added new music by Lena Raine and Samuel \u00c5berg\n19. Music Disc 5 Unlike other discs, it can only be obtained by finding and crafting nine disc fragments together These disc fragments can be found rarely in ancient city chests\n20. Unlike other discs, it can only be obtained by finding and crafting nine disc fragments together\n21. These disc fragments can be found rarely in ancient city chests\n22.

We know the community has found ways to build shaders on top of HAL and with this change, these shaders will no longer function. We understand that this is a valuable feature for players and the creator community, and we are working on how we may be able to deliver this sort of creative capability to players and creators in an officially supported way. While we have nothing to share right now, look out for more details in the future.\n170. Important! In this release, we are removing the Additional Modding Capabilities experiment. This experiment contained experimental JavaScript APIs launched in 2018 \u2013 and with this removal, JavaScript within worlds associated with this API will no longer function. GameTest Framework \u2013 a separate JavaScript API \u2013 should not be impacted, nor should behavior pack/resource pack type add-ons more broadly.\n171. You can read more about this via this article .\n172. A world with \"StorageVersion\" 8 or lower will be increased to 9 and have its \"RandomSeed\" upgraded from using only the lower 32 bits of a 64-bit number to using the full 64-bit range while still representing the same number.

Added Knockback Height Cap value to KnockbackRoarGoal\n201. JSON format for events sent from websocket server and Code Builder APIs updated to hierarchical JSON format instead of flat format\n202. Less useful properties removed with block and item IDs moved to newer name-based format instead of numerical format\n203. Agent-based commands in websockets moved to new \"action:agent\" format, and all commands are now queued and include unique ids to correlate responses\n204. Any future breaking changes to websocket and Code Builder APIs will now result in the \"protocolVersion\" being incremented\n205. Molang expressions inside animation scripts for actor resource definition (pre_animation and initialize) that contain capital letters are properly evaluated now with format_version 1.18.20 or higher\n206. Clarified documentation for query.is_item_name_any that the slot index is required when there is more than one slot, i.e. the hotbar\n207. Fixed Logical AND to evaluate before Logical OR, and for comparison operators to evaluate before equality operators This is a Molang Versioned Change that only takes effect for Molang expressions in packs that use a min_engine_version of 1.18.20 or higher For example, A && B || C now evaluates as (A && B) || C and A < B == C > D now evaluates as (A < B) == (C > D)\n208.

Fixed an issue where event times were not considered within the animation length calculation that happens when \"animation_length\" is not explicitly specified\n215. Fixed arrow operator to return 0 if the left side is not a valid entity or item, rather than causing the entire expression to return 0 For example, if\u00a0bis not valid\u00a0variable.a = variable.b->variable.c\u00a0will now assign 0 to\u00a0variable.a This is not a\u00a0Molang Versioned Changebecause no known content is currently using the arrow operator\n216.

This is a Molang Versioned Change that only takes effect for Molang expressions in packs that use a min_engine_version of 1.18.10 or higher\n222. Previously nested conditional expressions like\u00a0'A?B:C?D:E'would evaluate as\u00a0' (A?B:C)?D:E', now they evaluate as\u00a0'A?B:(C?D:E'\n223.

    "md": "__**Minecraft - Caves & Cliffs: Part II - 1.18.0 (Bedrock)**__\n> The day has arrived and Minecraft Caves & Cliffs: Part II has officially released to the world! It is, indeed, a very special day when we all get to boot up our devices and see a new update ready to download and play. It represents years of hard work from both our team of developers, as well as the community's continued passion for creating endless worlds in Minecraft. The update is available on all Bedrock platforms right now and we can't wait for you to jump in and experience one of the biggest updates in Minecraft's history. Here's a bit of what to expect when you load into the game today:\n\n**Fixes:**\n1. Increased the world height and depth, adding 50% more vertical space to build and explore\n2. New cave generation to explore below your existing worlds\n3. New cave and mountain biomes like Lush Caves and Jagged Peaks\n4. Drastically updated and improved biome, cave, and ore generation\n5. Added several new music tracks to enjoy during gameplay\n6. Fixed over 70 bugs, issues, and parity changes\n7. Overworld height and depth for new and existing worlds has been extended to y320 and y-64, opening up more space to explore and build in\n8. Players can now update existing worlds to include the new overworld height dimensions and world generation features. See our World Upgrading FAQ for more details\n9. The bedrock layer at y0 below saved chunks will be replaced with Deepslate and feature new cave generation underneath\n10. Biomes and terrain generating across new and existing chunk borders will blend seamlessly, creating natural-looking environmental transitions\n11. Terrain shape and elevation is no longer always determined by biome, resulting in new biome placements such as deserts on top of hills\n12. Mountains are taller than ever and can now generate up to a maximum height of 256 blocks\n13. Added 3D biomes - cave biomes can now generate directly below surface biomes\n14. New cave and mountain biomes added, including Jagged Peaks, Meadows, Lush Caves and Dripstone Caves\n15. Added noise caves - the three primary types of noise caves are large, open Cheese Caves, wide, tunnelling Spaghetti Caves and the narrow, winding Noodle Caves\n16. Added aquifers - these create local level bodies of water such as flooded caves or underground lakes\n17. Added large ore veins - these long formations stretch through cave systems and contain larger deposits of ore than the clusters usually found underground\n18. Ore distribution has been adjusted to compensate for the new world height\n19. Monsters will now only spawn in complete darkness. Players can spawn-proof dark areas such as caves using light sources\n20. Added new music by Lena Raine and Kumi Tanioka\n21. Added a new music disc from Lena Raine titled \"otherside\". This can be found rarely in Stronghold corridor chests or much more rarely in Dungeon chests\n22.

Be sure to backup your worlds before enabling experimental toggles and see our updated FAQ on how to enable Experiments\n35. Removed \"Old\" world type from the world creation screen\n36. Locked Old worlds to BaseGameVersion 1.17.40\n37. Existing Old worlds are still playable but will not be updated with 1.18 features\n38. For more information on Old world changes, please see the FAQ article\n39. Added a new main menu panorama showing the beautiful cliffs of the Overworld\n40. Players with external storage will be migrated to new location at start up, due to storage changes required by Google. You can still play if migration fails by closing the results window\n41. With external storage being migrated to its new location in preparation for Google's new API requirements, you will now lose your data if you uninstall Minecraft, unless you check the box indicating you want to keep your data. We recommend checking this box if you wish to keep your worlds in the event you choose to reinstall Minecraft\n42. For more information on storage changes, please see the FAQ article\n43. New world generation in this release is currently incompatible with the 'Creation of Custom Biomes' experimental toggle. Expect worlds with custom biome generation to be potentially unstable and for custom biomes to only exist in currently saved out areas of the world.\n44. World generation for the Minecraft Overworld has changed entirely with this release. This means old seeds will no longer spawn players in the same positions when playing 1.18. If creators are version locked to an old version of the game, their seeds will generate worlds as they were prior to 1.18.\n45. Fixed several crashes that could occur during gameplay\n46.

Education Edition: NPCs no longer have idle sounds ( MCPE-141856 )\n74. Breaking a block below fire no longer creates an invisible fire block when the 'doFireTick' gamerule is disabled ( MCPE-101371 )\n75. Players can once again continuously place water, lava, and Powder Snow by holding down the 'Place' button ( MCPE-139671 )\n76. Light blocks no longer support blocks that need support, e.g. Beds and Paintings ( MCPE-144311 )\n77. Light blocks will now survive a TNT or Creeper explosion\n78. All ground vegetation can now be placed on Mycelium ( MCPE-125928 )\n79. Fixed shallow water turning brighter when aimed at while holding a Small Drip Leaf ( MCPE-123373 )\n80.

    "md": "__**Minecraft - Caves & Cliffs: Part I - 1.17.0 (Bedrock)**__\n> Please search for any bugs you find onbugs.mojang.comand let us know what you think atfeedback.minecraft.net.\n\n**Fixes:**\n1. Axolotls are amphibious creatures that spawn in underground water\n2. Holding a Bucket of Tropical Fish will cause nearby Axolotls to follow the player on both land and in water. Axolotls cannot be tamed but can be bred by feeding them Buckets of Tropical Fish\n3. Axolotl will attack Fish, Squid, Drowned, and Guardians!\n4. Axolotls come in a variety of colors, all with an equal chance of spawning except for blue. Blue Axolotls have a small chance of spawning as a mutation when breeding two Axolotls\n5. Axolotls can survive on dry land for a few minutes. After that they will start to dry out and take continuous damage until rehydrated\n6. When taking damage, there is a chance that the Axolotl will play dead. While playing dead, the Axolotl will regenerate health and mobs will be unable to target the Axolotl\n7. When a player kills a mob that the Axolotl was attacking, they are rewarded with the regeneration effect and their mining fatigue is removed, if they had it\n8. Axolotls can be picked up with buckets, just like fish!\n9. The winning mob of the MINECON Live 2019 mob vote!\n10. For now, Goats spawn in Extreme Hills. This will change with Caves & Cliffs: Part II\n11. Goats will occasionally ram into players and other mobs\n12. Goats can jump high and take less fall damage than other mobs\n13. Goats will avoid walking onto Powder Snow\n14. Goats can be bred and tempted using Wheat\n15. Use an empty Bucket to get Milk\n16. Keep an ear out for the elusive Screamer Goat!\n17. The winning mob of the Minecraft Live 2020 mob vote!\n18. Glow squids are aquatic creatures that spawn in underground water\n19. When killed, glow squid drop Glow Ink\u00a0Sacs\n20. Craft a Glow Item Frame by combining a glow ink sac with an item frame in a crafting table\n21. Any item in a Glow Item Frame is perfectly illuminated, even at night!\n22. If a Sign is interacted with a Glow Ink Sac, the text will then get a glowing effect\n23. Mobs inside a block of powder snow start to freeze and eventually take\u00a0damage\n24. Players can protect themselves from powder snow by equipping leather\u00a0armor\n25. Cauldrons fill up in snowy weather, creating a renewable source of powder snow. It will also generate naturally in certain snowy biomes when Caves & Cliffs: Part II releases\n26. Buckets can be used to scoop up and place powder\u00a0snow\n27. Most mobs cannot walk on powder snow and fall into the block\u00a0instead\n28. Skeletons transform into strays after standing in powder snow for awhile\n29. Wearing Leather Boots allows a player or mob to walk on Powder Snow without falling in\n30. A dim light source that appears on cave walls and in underground lakes\n31. Use bone meal to spread it along block surfaces and harvest it using shears\n32. These huge Geodes can be found anywhere underground of newly generated chunks in the Overworld\n33. Amethyst Geodes have an outer layer of Smooth Basalt Blocks and a second layer of Calcite Blocks\n34. Inside Geodes, there is an inner layer of various Amethyst Blocks\n35. All types of Amethyst blocks (including Clusters) create beautiful sounds when you walk on them, break them, place them, or hit them with a projectile \u2013 go make some music!\n36. Amethyst comes in block form inside the Geodes in two ways: Block of Amethyst Block and Budding Amethyst\n37. Amethyst Clusters grow from budding Amethyst, which can be found inside Geodes\n38. Clusters have four growth stages: Small Amethyst Bud, Medium Amethyst Bud, Large Amethyst Bud, and Amethyst Cluster\n39. Fully-grown Amethyst clusters drop four Amethyst Shards (or more with the Fortune enchantment) when a Pickaxe is used, and drop two Amethyst Shards when broken by hand, Piston, or other means\n40. Clusters can be mined with the Silk Touch enchantment at any stage of growth\n41. On any side of a Budding Amethyst Block where there is air or a water source block, a Small Amethyst Bud will eventually grow\n42. Amethyst Buds can only grow when attached to Budding Amethyst, and will grow until they become a full Amethyst Cluster\n43. Clusters can only grow when they are placed on budding Amethyst Blocks\n44. Amethyst Shards are items used in a variety of crafting recipes\n45. Though visually transparent, light does not pass through Tinted Glass\n46. Can be crafted by putting a Glass Block in the middle of four Amethyst Shards on a Crafting Table\n47. Tinted Glass can be obtained without the Silk Touch enchantment and does not shatter when broken, like normal Glass\n48. Copper Ore can now be found underground in newly generated chunks and can be smelted into Copper Ingots\n49. Block of Copper and Cut Copper can be crafted, as well as stairs and slabs\n50. After being placed in the world, Copper Blocks will oxidize slowly over time, turning to exposed Copper, Weathered Copper, and Oxidized Copper\n51. Copper Blocks that are not fully oxidized can be waxed to prevent further oxidation, either by using a Honeycomb item on them, by using the crafting grid, or by using a Dispenser loaded with Honeycombs\n52. Axes can scrape off wax and oxidation from Copper Blocks\n53. All lightning strikes that happen within a radius of 64 blocks from a Lightning Rod will strike the Lightning Rod\n54. Lightning rods can be crafted using Copper ingots in a Crafting Table\n55. A Lightning Rod struck by lightning will emit a full Redstone signal for 8 game ticks\n56. The Spyglass is used to see far away places and can be crafted with Copper Ingots and an Amethyst Shard\n57. Camera movement when looking through a Spyglass is slowed to make it more comfortable to use. This is adjustable using the Spyglass Damping slider in Settings on Bedrock Edition\n58. Added Raw Copper, Raw Iron, and Raw Gold items\n59. Ores that are smeltable now drop raw item forms of the ore instead of the ore block, and these can be smelted just like before\n60. This is to prevent cluttering the inventory and have consistency with Fortune on all ores\n61. Ore blocks are still smeltable, meaning you can still smelt ore blocks you've obtained previously or with the Silk Touch enchantment\n62. Added block of Raw Copper, Raw Iron, and Raw Gold\n63. Just like other ore materials, you can craft a compact block with raw ore items to save inventory space or use as decoration\n64. Raw ore blocks can be placed on a crafting grid to break down into the original raw ore items\n65. Deepslate is generated in blobs below y = 16\n66. Mining it with a Pickaxe will drop Cobbled Deepslate, which can be smelted back into Deepslate\n67. When ore is generated in the same place as Deepslate, Deepslate variants of that ore are now generated instead\n68. Deepslate Blocks can be crafted into Polished Deepslate, Deepslate Tile, and Deepslate Brick Blocks, including slabs, stairs, and walls\n69. Deepslate Blocks also come in Cracked Tile, Cracked Brick, Chiseled, and Infested variants\n70. Stone tools can be crafted using Cobbled Deepslate\n71. A new decorative block\n72. Blobs of Tuff Blocks generate in the world below y = 16\n73. Basalt blocks can now be smelted into smooth basalt blocks as a new decorative block\n74. While Lush Caves and other new cave biomes won\u2019t generate until the Caves & Cliffs: Part II update, many new blocks are now available through the Creative mode inventory or certain aspects of Survival mode\n75. Added the following trades to the Mason: Will sell 4 Dripstone Blocks for 1 Emerald\n76. Will sell 4 Dripstone Blocks for 1 Emerald\n77. Added the following trades to the Wandering Trader: Will sell 2 Pointed Dripstones for 1 Emerald Will sell 2 Rooted Dirt for 1 Emerald Will sell 2 Moss Blocks for 1 Emerald\n78. Will sell 2 Pointed Dripstones for 1 Emerald\n79. Will sell 2 Rooted Dirt for 1 Emerald\n80. Will sell 2 Moss Blocks for 1 Emerald\n81. Moss Blocks can be found in Shipwreck Chests\n82. Glow Berries can be found in Mineshaft Chest Minecarts\n83. Pointed Dripstone can be placed on the ceiling (stalactites) or ground (stalagmites)\n84. Watch out! If a stalactite is broken, it will fall and cause damage to players and mobs\n85. Players and mobs will take damage if landing on a stalagmite\n86. If a stalactite is under a water source or lava source, it will slowly fill Cauldrons\n87. If a stalactite and stalagmite touch, they will connect into a full column\n88. A Dripstone Block can be crafted with four Pointed Dripstone\n89. Small Dripleaf will grow into Big Dripleaf when fertilized with Bone Meal\n90. Big Dripleaf is a platforming block. Players and mobs on top of the block will cause the block to tilt and drop\n91. When Moss Blocks are fertilized with Bone Meal, Moss has a chance of spreading to other blocks. Moss Carpet, Azaleas, and Flowering Azaleas also have a chance of growing\n92. The Hoe is the most efficient tool to harvest Moss Blocks and Moss Carpet\n93. Azalea and Flowering Azaleas are new decorative plants\n94. Azaleas have a chance of growing after using Bone Meal on Moss Blocks\n95. Fertilizing an Azalea with Bone Meal will transform it into a tree with Azalea Leaves and Flowered Azalea Leaves, which can be harvested using Shears\n96. Azalea and Flowering Azalea can also be used as Furnace fuel\n97. Tilling Rooted Dirt with a Hoe turns the block to normal Dirt and drops Hanging Roots\n98. Fertilizing Rooted Dirt with Bone Meal causes Hanging Roots to grow below\n99. Glow Berries can be planted on the bottom of most solid blocks to grow cave vines\n100. They can be eaten and are as nutritious as Sweet Berries\n101. Use them to lure and breed Foxes\n102. When Cave Vines grow or are fertilized with Bone Meal, they have a chance of growing Glow Berries\n103. A Cave Vine that has Glow Berries emits light. So pretty!\n104. Cave Vines are climbable\n105. Currently, Spore Blossoms are only available in the Creative mode inventory\n106. Spore Blossoms are a new decorative block that can be placed underneath any block\n107. Wax On Wax Off - Apply and remove Wax from all the Copper blocks\n108. Float Your Goat - Get in a boat and float with a Goat\n109. The Healing Power of Friendship - Team up with an Axolotl and win a fight\n110. Improved visibility when swimming in underwater caves\n111. A new, beautiful main menu panorama for Caves & Cliffs: Part\u00a0I\n112. Updated the appearance of the initial loading screen\n113. Compass and Clock item textures have been updated\n114.

Changed the BlockDescriptor BlockLegacy member variable to a Block* so we can set the block states during deferred block resolution and get the block with the states set\n220. Removed all the existing Block* json parsing\n221. Split\u00a0'allowed_blocks'\u00a0into\u00a0'use_on'\u00a0and\u00a0'dispense_on'\n222. 'use_on'\u00a0specifies what blocks an entity placer item is allowed to be used on, omit to allow all blocks\n223. 'dispense_on'\u00a0specifies what blocks an entity placer item is allowed to be dispensed on, omit to allow all blocks\n224. Added support to item json events for the 'execute_command' keyword. It supports both a string and string array format, where the string is the command intended to run. Commands are compiled at load time and executed after add/remove_mob_effect and teleport actions, but before other triggers for events. Commands will be segmented in sequence and randomize nodes as expected\n225. Added support to entity json events for the 'run_command' keyword alongside the current add and remove keywords. It supports both a string and string array format, where the string is the command intended to run. Commands will be run after component groups have been added and removed, and will be segmented in sequence and randomize nodes as expected\n226.

Spatial Bandwidth Optimizations are now exposed through a component, \"minecraft:conditional_bandwidth_optimization\"\n273. Spatial Bandwidth Optimizations are now utilized by every actor using \"minecraft:conditional_bandwidth_optimization\"\n274. Added the selector component to raw text, which can be used to print entity names in commands such as 'tellraw' and 'titleraw'\n275. Pathfinding will now account for the \"minecraft:scale'\" component\n276. Updated\u00a0BrewingStand,\u00a0ButtonBlock,\u00a0ChestBlock,\u00a0EnderChestBlock,\u00a0SlabBlock, and\u00a0SoulSandBlockblock types to allow path-finding and navigation ( MCPE-47075 )\n277. Updated Actor Properties. Two fields that were invalid and appeared in some vanilla content will now give a content error. The field \"value\" on \"minecraft:can_fly\" and the property \"minecraft:foot_size\" should simply be removed from any entity files\n278. The 'MoveToLiquidGoal ' has been changed to use data for its target block\n279. Strider now correctly executes the 'move_to_liquid' goal\n280. Made boats use the Buoyancy component. Added two new components, the \"inside_block_notifier\" component, which fires specified events when the actor enters or exits specified blocks, and the \"out_of_control\" component, which sets a corresponding actor flag, in order to make this possible\n281. Exposed new data parameters to control the behavior of Drop Item For Goal. This includes: \"seconds_before_pickup\", \"cooldown\", \"minimum_teleport_distance\", \"max_head_look_at_height\", \"teleport_offset\", and \"entity_types\".

Check out the new Actor component documentation!\n283. Added error checks to parsing of Minecraft shareables items. Displays content log if item name is invalid or the array is empty\n284. Created '/fog' command for managing active fog settings for players; these fog settings override fog driven from the client such as biome location of player camera\n285. Updated \"biomes_client.json\" to link each biome to a fog definition identifier\n286. Added child object \"volumetric\" which contains \"density\" and \"media_coefficients\" objects. These hold the data values used for the volumetric fog\n287. Items can now be made records to play music in Jukeboxes\n288.

Examples When added to JukeBox Block this will play the sound clip of \"record.chirp\" Example 1: \"minecraft:record\": { \"sound_event\": \"chirp\", \"duration\": 185.0, \"comparator_signal\": 4 }\n293. When added to JukeBox Block this will play the sound clip of \"record.chirp\"\n294. Example 1: \"minecraft:record\": { \"sound_event\": \"chirp\", \"duration\": 185.0, \"comparator_signal\": 4 }\n295. Renamed items to be consistent with the list of Java Edition items\n296. Created RepairableItemComponent that data-drives how an item is repaired in game\n297. Items can now override their display name with a localized 'value'. If a value is not supplied, the component will stay with its default name. If the value supplied is not in the localization file, the display name will be the value string\n298. Added a Lock in Inventory component that can be applied to an item via the '/give' and '/replaceitem' commands. This prevents the item from being removed from the player's inventory, dropped, or crafted with Example of use: `/give @s apple 1 0 {\"item_lock\": {\"mode\": \"lock_in_inventory\"}}`\n299.

Are you ready to make your new home in the Nether? With so many new features, changes, and fixes, it\u2019s difficult to pin the scope of this update into just a few points but here we go!\n\n**Fixes:**\n1. Four new Nether biomes including Crimson Forest, Warped Forest, Soulsand Valley, and Basalt Deltas\n2. Watch out for a collection of new dangers like Piglins and Hoglins, and keep your eyes open for the ridable, lava walking Strider\n3. Get building with new bricks and wood galore and get growing with eerie new vegetation\n4. New music and ambient sounds fill the air, including fresh tunes from Lena Raine and includes a snappy tune called \u201cPigstep\u201d\n5. Keep yourself safe and take your diamond gear to the next level with Netherite\n6. Over 300 bug fixes since the Buzzy Bees update, with fixes to over 180 community reported bugs\n7. Be sure to check out the list of parity updates, as we address some issues regarding mob spawning, curses, villages, aquatic music, and sounds\n8. Warped Nylium carpets the cave floor with all kinds of strange new vegetation\n9. Huge Warped Fungi make up the \"trees\" of this forest, with Shroomlights lighting up the forest floor\n10. Warped Wart blocks can be cleared quickly using a hoe\n11. A dark blue fog covers the forest!\n12. Warped spores swirl through the air\n13. Twisting Vines grow from the cave floor and fungi\n14. The Warped Forests are strange, but also the least hostile place of Nether\n15. Crimson Nylium carpets the cave floor with all kinds of strange new vegetation\n16. Huge Crimson Fungi make up the \"trees\" of this forest, with Shroomlights lighting up the forest floor\n17. Nether Wart blocks can be cleared quickly using a hoe\n18. Weeping Vines grow from the cave ceilings and fungi\n19. Hoglins wander these forests\n20. Crimson spores swirl through the air\n21. An\u00a0open\u00a0space\u00a0made\u00a0mostly\u00a0of\u00a0Soul\u00a0Sand\u00a0and\u00a0Soul\u00a0Soil\n22. Basalt\u00a0pillars\u00a0span\u00a0from\u00a0floor\u00a0to\u00a0ceiling\n23.

A\u00a0light\u00a0blue\u00a0glow\u00a0envelopes\u00a0the\u00a0valley\n26. Beware\u00a0of\u00a0Skeletons\u00a0here\n27. Remnants of volcanic eruptions, this biome sports a high concentration of Basalt columns and lava deltas\n28. Walking through, you will be surrounded by flakes of flowing white ash\n29. Magma Cubes finally have a place to call home, spawning very frequently\n30. A new block, Blackstone, can be found in large patches here\n31. The original Nether biome is now called Nether Wastes\n32. Biome fog color smoothly blends between biomes. Smooth.\n33. Piglins are an aggressive civilization that live in the Nether\n34. They mostly hang around in the Crimson Forest, but you might find some in the Nether Wastes, too\n35. They think of players as target practice and will attack on sight\n36. However, if you dress appropriately, they will see you as a respectable figure, or tolerable at least\n37. Piglins are suspicious of strangers and if they see you opening a chest or mining a block of gold, they will assume that you're stealing and will treat you accordingly\n38. Piglins LOVE gold and get very distracted by gold items\n39. Gold ingots are currency to piglins, and you can throw ingots at them or interact with them while holding an ingot to barter for various goods\n40. Piglins sometimes get hungry and hunt hoglins for food. Or they try at least. The results... vary\n41. Piglins prefer to hunt and fight in groups and when a fight is happening, everyone wants in\n42. Piglins that somehow end up in the overworld become zombified fairly quickly\n43. Piglins are creeped out by soul fire and zombified piglins, and will stay clear whenever possible\n44. Wither skeletons are a historic enemy and piglins will attack on sight\n45. Baby piglins are not as dangerous but they can be mischievous, so watch your back\n46. ... and they like to play with baby hoglins\n47. Hoglins\u00a0are\u00a0big\u00a0aggressive\u00a0beasts\u00a0that\u00a0live\u00a0in\u00a0Crimson\u00a0Forests\n48.

They\u00a0spawn\u00a0in\u00a0lava,\u00a0and\u00a0are\u00a0fire\u00a0immune\n60. When\u00a0they\u00a0are\u00a0not\u00a0in\u00a0lava,\u00a0they\u00a0freeze, shiver,\u00a0and\u00a0move\u00a0slower\n61.

Zombie pigmen are now known as zombified piglins, and they now have ears... well, at least one ear\n64. Zoglins\u00a0are\u00a0zombified\u00a0hoglins\u00a0-\u00a0the\u00a0result\u00a0of\u00a0bringing\u00a0a\u00a0hoglin\u00a0into\u00a0the\u00a0overworld\n65. Unlike\u00a0hoglins,\u00a0they\u00a0can't\u00a0be\u00a0bred\u00a0or\u00a0fed,\u00a0and\u00a0they\u00a0don't\u00a0care\u00a0about\u00a0warped\u00a0fungus\n66. Beware\u00a0-\u00a0these\u00a0beasts\u00a0are\u00a0raving\u00a0mad\u00a0and\u00a0attack\u00a0just\u00a0about\u00a0everything\u00a0they\u00a0see!\n67.

Added 4 separate Bastion Remnant types: Bridge, Hoglin Stable, Housing Units, and Treasure Room\n69. You can find these sizable structures in all biomes in the Nether, except for the ashy cliffs of Basalt Deltas\n70. Explore, loot, and conquer a Bastion Remnant to call it your home...but beware, Piglins don't take kindly to intruders stealing their things\n71. Added a new music disc from Lena Raine titled 'Pigstep', which can only be found in Bastion chests\n72. Added a new set of stone blocks with regular, polished, and polished brick variants!\n73. Added Gilded Blackstone - Blackstone which has been imbued with gold and has a chance of dropping gold nuggets when broken\n74. You can find these new blocks in Bastion Remnants\n75. Blackstone can be used to craft a Furnace\n76. Blackstone can be used to craft stone tools\n77. Added the respawn anchor that can set your respawn point in the Nether\n78. Use while holding Glowstone to charge to a maximum of four charges - each respawn depletes one charge\n79. You can charge the Respawn Anchor using a Dispenser\n80. Netherite items float in lava so you don't lose all your gear after that unplanned lava bath\n81. Netherite tools work faster and last longer than diamond\n82. Netherite weapons do more damage than diamond\n83. Netherite armor have higher toughness and durability than diamond\n84. Netherite items have higher enchantment value than diamond (but not as high as gold)\n85. Netherite armor gives you knockback resistance, so you barely get knocked back at all when hit by arrows and such- Netherite blocks can be used as the base of a beacon and netherite ingots can be used as the fuel for a beacon. Weird flex but ok\n86. And it looks cool!\n87. Mine ancient debris in the lower depths of the Nether. At own risk. No insurance coverage for that\n88. Refine it into netherite scrap in a furnace or blast furnace\n89. Combine 4 netherite scrap with 4 gold ingots in a crafting table to make a netherite ingot\n90. Add one of your diamond tools or armor pieces into a Smithing Table with a netherite ingot\n91. The Smithing Table will preview your new netherite item in the right slot. Take it out to craft!\n92. The\u00a0closer\u00a0you\u00a0hit\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0center,\u00a0the\u00a0larger\u00a0the\u00a0redstone\u00a0signal!\n93. You\u00a0will\u00a0need\u00a0one\u00a0hay\u00a0block\u00a0and\u00a0four\u00a0redstone\u00a0for\u00a0this\u00a0recipe\n94. Shine your boots of choice with this soul-sucking enchantment to speed around on Soul Sand and Soul Soil!\n95. There's a downside: Enchantments will slowly degrade your boots each Soul block you walk on\n96. Can only be obtained by bartering with those pesky Piglins\n97. Crafted from a netherite ingot and chiseled stone bricks\n98. Use a compass on a lodestone to point the compass to that lodestone\n99. Two new non-flammable wood-like materials - Crimson Stems and Warped Stems\n100. Hyphae of Crimson and Warped Stems, including their stripped versions, can be crafted. Similar to wood from the Overworld\n101. Basalt blocks - you can find them as pillars, but they can be placed in any direction\n102. New ground surface blocks: Crimson Nylium and Warped Nylium\n103. Using bone meal on Netherrack can spread Nylium\n104. New vegetation: Nether Sprouts, Crimson Roots, and Warped Roots Warped and Crimson roots and fungi can be placed into pots\n105. Warped and Crimson roots and fungi can be placed into pots\n106. Two types of Fungi: Crimson and Warped - try using bone meal to grow them!\n107. Warped Wart blocks\n108.

Soul Campfire - A campfire with blue flames craftable with Soul Soil or Soul Sand\n114. Added patches of Blackstone and Gravel to all Nether biomes at and below lava level\n115. Nether gold ore can now spawn in the nether!\n116. Nether gold ore can be mined with any pickaxe and will drop gold nuggets\n117. Added Chiseled Nether Bricks, Cracked Nether Bricks, and Quartz Bricks blocks\n118. We\u2019ve added three new tracks, all composed by the very talented Lena Raine Rubedo is played in the Nether Wastes Chrysopoeia is played in Crimson Forests So Below is played in Soulsand Valleys\n119. Rubedo is played in the Nether Wastes\n120. Chrysopoeia is played in Crimson Forests\n121. So Below is played in Soulsand Valleys\n122. Added moody sounds to the Nether\n123. Added underwater music\n124. Added ambient cave sounds\n125. A large amount of sounds have had their volume and pitch slightly changed in order to get close to Java Edition parity\n126. Players can now use Emote animations in game as a fun way to express themselves! Emotes are assigned to an Emote wheel within the Dressing Room. There are Emotes available for free, purchase, and as achievement rewards\n127. This feature rewards players with Dressing Room items when completing achievements. If an achievement is already unlocked, the reward can be redeemed immediately. Rewards are the full gambit of Dressing Room items, including Emotes\n128. Bullseye \u2013 Hit the bullseye of a Target block (15G)\n129. Cover me in debris \u2013 Wear a full set of Netherite armor (50G)\n130. Oooh, shiny! \u2013 Distract a Piglin using gold (30G)\n131. Hot tourist destination \u2013 Visit all Nether biomes (30G)\n132. Bedrock mob despawn rules have been changed to now work similarly to Java Edition's mob despawn rules. This allows mobs to more consistently despawn around the player\n133. Any mobs that have been set to persist (tempted, name-tagged, tamed, bred, etc.) will never naturally despawn\n134. Almost all naturally spawning mobs will automatically despawn when they're 44 blocks or further away from the nearest players in a world with simulation distance 4. On higher simulation distances, mobs are despawned when they're in a chunk at the edge of the simulation distance up to a distance or 128 blocks from the nearest player\n135.

Now when teleporting an Armor Stand to a player, it rotates the Armor Stand to the player's orientation\u00a0( MCPE-35979 )\n449. Added new overload for\u00a0'/replaceitem'with an option for\u00a0destroy\u00a0(the old behavior) or\u00a0keep\u00a0(the command will return an error if an item occupies that slot)\n450. Fixed an issue that prevented players from being teleported to a nearby chunk that the game thought was too far away\n451.

For a mob to admire an item they need to have both the admire_item goal and the admire_item component, and the relevant configuration need to be done in the interact component and/or the shareables component\n466. Several new variables have been introduced to the angry component\n467. Goal Variables broadcast_anger_on_attack - If true the mob will send a pulse of brodcast anger whenever it attacks, broadcast_anger must also be true for this to work broadcast_anger_on_being_attacked - If true the mob will send a pulse of brodcast anger whenever it is attacked, broadcast_anger must also be true for this to work angry_sound - The sound event to play when the mob is angrysound_interval - The range of time in seconds to randomly wait before playing the sound again\n468. broadcast_anger_on_attack - If true the mob will send a pulse of brodcast anger whenever it attacks, broadcast_anger must also be true for this to work\n469. broadcast_anger_on_being_attacked - If true the mob will send a pulse of brodcast anger whenever it is attacked, broadcast_anger must also be true for this to work\n470. angry_sound - The sound event to play when the mob is angrysound_interval - The range of time in seconds to randomly wait before playing the sound again\n471.

Goal Variables priority - Specifies how the mob should prioritize this goal\n482. priority - Specifies how the mob should prioritize this goal\n483. Specifies that the mob should have the hunt celebration behavior\n484. Component Variables broadcast - If true, celebration will be broadcasted to other entities in the radius.

Added the MoveToLava goal, similar to MoveToWater goal. Mob tries to find and move to lava\n497. Navigation component now has can_path_over_lava and can_walk_in_lava parameters, allowing mobs (like the strider) to traverse lava\n498. Changed the priority from the damage type to the \"ignore_mob_damage\" flag (if that flag is set and a mob attacks the mob with the Panic Goal, they will not panic even if the damage type matches one in their \"damage_sources\" list)\n499. Changed damage types from being hard-coded to being data-driven using the existing \"Entity Damage Sources\"\n500. Changed the default from \"fire, fire_tick, magma\" (old, hardcoded behavior) to \"all\"\n501. Pre-1.16 mobs will default to \"fire, fire_tick, magma\"\n502. The PickupItemsGoal only considers items that the mob can reach When determining whether the goal can be used, we now check whether the mob can reach an item it\u2019s interested in, before committing to it as the target of the goal. This is to avoid mobs getting stuck in this goal after deciding to pick up an item they cannot reach\n503.

This is to avoid mobs getting stuck in this goal after deciding to pick up an item they cannot reach\n504. PickupBasedOnChance variable This new variable was added to be used for monsters that can pick up items sometimes but also preserve mobs that used this goal in the past like Villagers. If this variable is true, the mob will have a calculation done (based on things like time played by the player, game difficulty, and moon brightness) to determine if this is a mob that is allowed to pick up items. That value is only calculated on the mob\u2019s first spawn, which means it is forever saved on that mob and doesn\u2019t change. If the variable is false (which it is by default), the mob will always be able to pick up items using the goal\n505.

If the variable is false (which it is by default), the mob will always be able to pick up items using the goal\n506. CanPickupAnyItem variable The PickupItemsGoal is dependent on the ShareableComponent and the items that are added to its items list. This new variable overrides that list and tells the component that this mob can pick up any item even if it isn\u2019t in the list. Items picked up because of this variable still honor the priority set to items in the list of items, however. This means that any items with a set priority in the list will still be picked up over any item that may be picked up because of this variable. By default, it is set to false\n507.

CooldownAfterBeingAttacked variable The variable cooldown_after_being_attacked has been added to the goal, specifying for how many seconds after being attacked the goal should be unavailable. The default value is 0\n509. The variable cooldown_after_being_attacked has been added to the goal, specifying for how many seconds after being attacked the goal should be unavailable. The default value is 0\n510. CanPickupToHandOrEquipment variable Specifying if the mob can equip items that it picks up or put items in its hand, or if it belongs in the inventory\n511. Specifying if the mob can equip items that it picks up or put items in its hand, or if it belongs in the inventory\n512. Component Variables item/barter - If true the mob will try to activate the barter goal after picking up the item, default value is false item/admire - If true the mob will try to activate the admire goal after picking up the item, default value is false item/consume_item - Specifies if an item should be consumed, for instance Piglins consume (eat) porkchop. Default value is false item/stored_in_inventory - Specifies if the item is desired to be picked up and stored in the mob\u2019s inventory. Default value is false\n513. item/barter - If true the mob will try to activate the barter goal after picking up the item, default value is false\n514. item/admire - If true the mob will try to activate the admire goal after picking up the item, default value is false\n515. item/consume_item - Specifies if an item should be consumed, for instance Piglins consume (eat) porkchop. Default value is false\n516. item/stored_in_inventory - Specifies if the item is desired to be picked up and stored in the mob\u2019s inventory. Default value is false\n517. The Splash Text loading code has been augmented to allow splash text JSON files to be additive, rather than replacing them completely, and to allow some conditional statements to disable splash text entries. Use a field called \"canMerge\" that sits next to the \"splashes\" field, it is a bool that defaults to 'false'. Also, another sibling of \"splashes\" is \"conditional\", which is an array of objects. Those objects contain a \"requires\" field and a \"splashes\" field. The \"splashes\" field is an array of strings like the original \"splashes\" field, and the \"requires\" field contains three fields - \"platforms\", \"treatments\", and \"stores\", each of which is an array of strings that is compared with the relevant data\n518. Made several Bedrock Dedicated Server documentation updates and fixes ( BDS-1084 , BDS-1085 , BDS-2341 , BDS-3051 , BDS-3141 )\n519. The\u00a0\"minecraft:density_limit\"\u00a0component is now documented in the Spawn Rules documentation section ( MCPE-61126 )\n520. Item tags can now be toggled in the UI using '/gamerule' showtags\n521. Added a new loop mode to animations - Now instead of omitting \"loop\" to have it stop playing when finished, or setting\u00a0\"loop\": true\u00a0to have it loop when finished, you can now say\u00a0\"loop\": \"hold_on_last_frame\"\u00a0to keep applying the last frame of animation\u00a0( MCM-675 )\n522. Optimized sound loading - \"load_on_low_memory\" is now deprecated in sound_definitions.json, as all audio can now play on low memory devices\n523. Removed\u00a0type\u00a0property from\u00a0\"minecraft:shooter\"\u00a0as it was never used\n524. Updated\u00a0\"minecraft:spawn_entity\"\u00a0to have an internal\u00a0entities\u00a0object or array\n525.

Invalid items in the \"spawn_item\" field of a \"minecraft:spawn_entity\" now display an error\n528. \"StompEggGoal\" no longer uses \"search_count\" as it now searches all blocks in the specified area\n529. Implemented 'AvoidMobTypeDefinition' and converted hardcoded properties to be data-driven\n530. A content error will now appear if you provide an invalid item name to 'minecraft:interact' in the 'transform_to_item' field\n531. Added documentation for 'minecraft:density_limit' ( MCPE-61126 )\n532. Adding a new subject to filters so damage sensors can filter on projectiles\n533. Custom brewing recipes can now output non-potion items\n534. Implemented a fix to the player's mount that ensures consistent, smooth rotation for all riders\n535. Custom bones in geometry now respect their custom parent bones' transformations\n536. The 'delayed_attack' behavior no longer causes mobs to freeze when they lose their target\n537. Fixed the \"MeleeAttackGoal\" to allow entities to hit target entities beneath them\n538. A content error will now show up if you provide an invalid item name to \"minecraft:interact\" in the \"transform_to_item\" field\n539. The 'on_unleash' event is now triggered correctly when unleashing from a fence\n540. The 'Create New World' button text is now using the global color component\n541. Custom entities that use the runtime identifier field now use the custom entity's name rather than the vanilla entity's name ( MCPE-56229 )\n542. Fixed collision boxes not updating from the 'collision_box' scripting component\n543. Functions with any invalid commands (E.g. incorrect selector syntax) will no longer register and cannot be called ( MCPE-64770 )\n544. Fixed an issue where sounds would sometimes have incorrect settings applied to them, causing 2D sounds to play as 3D and vice versa\n545. Comments in JSON arrays no longer cause an error ( MCPE-40873 )\n546. Entities no longer freeze when a component group containing a navigation component is removed\n547. The 'damage_sensor' component will now work on non-mob actors (Such as Ender Crystals)\n548. Dispensed splash and lingering potions now have potion effects in their projectile component\n549. 'pre_effect_script' no longer runs when an entity is despawning with 'minecraft:despawn'\n550. Fixed a bug where custom mobs with the 'runtime_identifier' field set would not return a custom mob spawn egg, if one was available\n551. A mob spawned in the air will no longer think it's on the ground once its movement is ticked and the 'on_ground' filter no longer always returns true\n552. Bee spawn eggs can now be edited\n553. Fixed an issue that could cause the 'minecraft:timer' component to fire prematurely in some conditions\n554. Fixed an issue that was causing particle animations to become inverted\n555. Using the 'minecraft:pushable' component will no longer break older content\n556. Fixed an issue that was preventing animation controllers in Behavior Packs from running on dedicated servers and Realms ( MCPE-59881 )\n557. Fixed\u00a0\"navigation.walk\"\u00a0to handle the case where it is used on a flying entity, so that the flying entity will not cause lag while it is touching the ground\n\n**Update:** https://feedback.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360044928311-Minecraft-Nether-Update-1-16-0-Bedrock"

Changes to Pack Manifests Summary As of 1.13, we have made some changes to the pack manifest with a new format version of \"2\".\u00a0We recommend that any new packs or world templates that you create use format version of 2 from now on. With this new format, there are a few additional changes to be aware of, detailed below All Pack Types The 'name' field in the header is now required for all pieces of content World Templates The 'lock_template_options' field is now required. This Boolean field determines whether the world options for your template should be locked to default values when a player creates a world from the template. They can still choose to unlock and modify the options, but will be warned that doing so could affect gameplay The 'base_game_version' field is required (see below for more info) The 'min_engine_version' field should no longer be used as it isn't parsed on world templates and produces a warning on import Resource and Behavior Packs The 'min_engine_version' field is now required. This affects how the game interprets some of the assets loaded from Resource and Behavior Packs. We recommend using the latest available version of the game for this field (e.g. '[1, 13, 0]') to ensure your pack works correctly Base Game Version Field For this field, we recommend using the value \"*\". This will ensure that anyone using your content in their Minecraft worlds will always get the latest base game (Vanilla) content when an update is available. In the case that your content relies on specific base game behavior, you can use this field to specify a base game version, starting with 1.13. If you choose to do this, you should omit the third octet; for example, if the version of the game you are targeting is '[1, 14, 2]', you would specify a version of '[1, 14, 0]').\u00a0If you specify a version this way, any worlds using your custom content will not get new base game content when it becomes available in future releases, which could help prevent unwanted changes to behavior in your content caused by updates to the base game. However, we still recommend using the \"*\" value to ensure players can continue to enjoy your content in their Minecraft worlds long-term while also receiving updates to the base game\n340.
